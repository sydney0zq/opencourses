##Diving Deeper into Memory

In this video and the next, we're going to deepen our understanding of memory. As you're probably beginning to understand, memory is only part of learning and developing expertise but it's often an important part. It may surprise you to learn that we have outstanding visual and spatial memory systems that can help form part of our long-term memory. Here's what I mean.

If you were asked to look around a house you never visited before, you'd soon have a sense of the general furniture layout and where the rooms were, color scheme, the pharmaceuticals in the bathroom cupboard. In just a few minutes, your mind would acquire and retain thousands of new pieces of information. Even weeks later, you'd still hold far more in your mind than if you'd spent the same amount of time staring at a blank wall. Your mind is built to retain this kind of general information about a place. You can greatly enhance your ability to remember if you tap into these naturally super-sized, visual, spatial memorization abilities. Our ancestors never needed a vast memory for names or numbers but they did need a memory for how to get back home from the three day deer hunt, or for the location of those plump blueberries on the rocky slopes to the South of the camp. These evolutionary needs helped lock in a superior "where things are" and "how they look" memory system（令我们发展出更专注于“东西在哪”以及“外观如何”的记忆系统）.

To begin tapping into your visual memory system try making a very memorable visual image representing one key item you want to remember. For example, here's an image you could use to remember Newton's second law, $f = ma$. This is a fundamental relationship relating force to mass and acceleration (force = mass x acceleration). And it only took humans, oh, a couple of hundred thousand years to figure out. The letter f in the formula could stand for flying, m could stand for mule, and a, well that's up to you.

**Part of the reason an image is so important to memory is that images connect directly to your right brain's visual spatial centers. The image helps you encapsulate a seemingly humdrum and hard to remember concept by tapping into visual areas with enhanced memory abilities. The more neural hooks you can build by evoking the senses, the easier it will be for you to recall the concept and what it means.** Beyond merely seeing the mule, you can smell the mule, you can feel the same windy pressure the mule is feeling. You can even hear the wind whistling past. The funnier and more evocative the images, the better. Focusing your attention brings something into your temporary working memory, but for that something to move from working memory to long term memory two things should happen: the idea should be memorable; there's a gigantic flying mule braying f = ma on my couch, and it must be repeated. Otherwise remember your tiny metabolic vampires, they can suck away the neural pattern related to that memory before it can strengthen and solidify.

Repetition is important. Even when you make something memorable, repetition helps get that memorable item firmly lodged into long-term memory. Remember to repeat not a bunch of times in one day but sporadically over several days. Index cards can often be helpful. Writing and saying what you're trying to learn seems to enhance retention. For example, if you're trying to learn concepts in physics you might take an index card and write the greek letter rho (ρ). That's a common abbreviation for density. You'd write it on one side and you'd write the remaining information on the other. Handwriting helps you to more deeply encode, that is convert into neural memory structures what you are trying to learn. The more you can turn what you're trying to remember into something memorable, the easier it will be to recall.


**You'll want to say the word and its meaning aloud to start setting auditory hooks to the material. Next, just look at the side of the card with the Greek letter rho (ρ) on it, and see whether you can remember what's on the other side of the card. If you can't, flip it over and remind yourself what you're supposed to know. If you can remember, put the card away. Now, do something else. Perhaps prepare another card and test yourself on it. Once you have several cards together, try running through them all and even mixing them around to see if you can remember them. This helps interleave your learning. Don't be surprised if you struggle a bit. Once you've given your cards a good try, put them away. Wait and take them out again, maybe before you go to sleep. Remember that sleep is when your mind repeats patterns and pieces together solutions. Briefly repeat what you want to remember over several days. Perhaps for a few minutes each morning or each evening. Gradually extend the time between the repetitions as the material firms itself into your mind.**


By increasing your spacing as you become more certain of mastery, you'll lock the material more firmly into place. Great flash card systems like Anki have built in algorithms that repeat in scale ranging from days to months. Interestingly, one of the best ways to remember people's names, is to simply try to retrieve the people's names from memory at increasing time intervals, after first learning the name.


##What is a Long Term Memory?

Welcome back to Learning How to Learn. What would it be like if you couldn't learn new things, you would not be able to remember new people you met, or remember what you were told? This actually happened to a famous patient in the annals of memory research whose initials were HM.

![](http://okye062gb.bkt.clouddn.com/2017-02-09-060818.jpg)

At the age of 27, HM had an operation for epilepsy that took out his hippocampus on both sides of his brain. The hippocampus has a shape of a seahorse and is named from the Greek hippos, meaning horse and kampos, meaning sea monster. The operation was a success. The epilepsy was cured but the price was steep. HM could no longer remember new things. He had become profoundly amnesic（遗忘的）. Curiously（奇怪的是）, you could have a normal conversation with HM, but if you left the room for a few minutes, he could not remember you or what you had discussed.


In the film Memento, the character played by Guy Pearce had this form of amnesia from a concussion. Note that he tattooed his body with messages, so that he would not forget what he had to do. HM could learn other things, like a new motor skill, but he could not remember having learned it. **There are multiple memory systems for different types of learning. From the studying HM and animals with similar operations, we have learned that the hippocampus is important part of a brain system for learning and memory of facts and events. Without the hippocampus and its inputs, it is not possible to store new memories in the cortex, a process called memory consolidation that can take many years.** HM could remember things from his childhood but he had trouble remembering things that had occurred in the years just before his operation, things that had not yet become fully consolidated. Something similar happens when you have a bad concussion but this usually resolves, unlike HM who never improved.


Memories are not fixed but living, breathing parts of your brain that are changing all of the time. Whenever you recall a memory, it changes, a process called, reconsolidation（再巩固）. It is even possible to implant（植入） false memories, which are indistinguishable from real ones by simply suggesting and imagining, especially in children who have vivid imaginations.

![](http://okye062gb.bkt.clouddn.com/2017-02-09-060841.jpg)

Here is a summary:
The green process of consolidation takes the brain state in active memory and stores it in long term memory by modifying synapses on the dendrites of neurons. These long term memories can remain dormant for a long time until the memory is retrieved and reinstated, by the red process, in short term working memory. The reinstated memory is in a new context, which can itself be transferred to long term memory, thereby, altering the old memory through reconsolidation.


Our memories are intertwined with each other. As we learn new things, our old memories also change. Like consolidation, reconsolidation also occurs during sleep. This is why it is more effective to space learning over time, rather than mass learning all at once. If you want to study something for an hour, you will retain it longer if you spend 10 minutes each month over a semester than an hour on one day. In contrast, if you wait until the day before an exam to cram the material, you may be able to retrieve for the next day on the exam but it will quickly fade from memory.

In addition to neurons, brains have several types of supporting cells called glial cells. The astrocyte is the most abundant glial cell in the human brain. Astrocytes provide nutrients to neurons, maintain extra cellular ion balance, and are involved with repair following injury. In this photo of the cortex, the astrocytes are staying green and the neurons are blue. The intricate arms of the astrocytes wrap around the neurons, each embracing thousands of synapses. A recent experiment suggest that these astrocytes may also have an important role in learning. When human astrocytes were put into mouse brains, the humanized mice learned faster. Interestingly, when Einstein's brain was examined to find out what made him so awesomely creative, the only difference that could be found was that he had many more astrocytes than the average human. Could astrocytes be the key to understanding human intelligence? Well, the more we learn about the brain, the more may we have to rethink learning.


##Creating Meaningful Groups and the Memory Palace Technique

In this video, we're going to delve deeper into memory. Another key to memorization is to create meaningful groups that simplify the material. Let's say you wanted to remember four plants that help ward off vampires. Garlic, rose, hawthorn and mustard. The first letters abbreviate to GRHM, so all you need to do to remember is use the image of a graham cracker.


It's much easier to remember numbers by associating them with memorable events. The year 1965 might be when one of your relatives was born for example. Or you can associate numbers with a numerical system you're familiar with. For example, 11.0 seconds is a good running time for the 100 meter dash. Or 75 might be the number of stitches on a knitting needle for the ski hats you like to make. Personally, I like to associate numbers with the feelings of, when was I was or will be at a given age. The number 18 is an easy one. That's the age when I went out into the world. By age 104 I hope to be an old, but happy great grandma.

Many disciplines（学科） use memorable sentences to help students memorize concepts. The first letter of each word in the sentence is also the first letter of each word in a list that needs to be memorized. Medicine, for example, is laden with memorable mnemonics. Among the cleaner of which are: “Some Lovers Try Positions That They Can't Handle”, to memorize the names of the carpal bones of the hand. And “Old People from Texas Eat Spiders”, for the cranial bones. Time after time, these kinds of memory tricks prove helpful.

![](http://okye062gb.bkt.clouddn.com/2017-02-09-063516.jpg)

The memory palace technique is a particularly powerful way of grouping things you want to remember. It involves calling to mind a familiar place. Like the layout of your house, and using it as a sort of a visual notepad where you can deposit the concept images that you want to remember. All you have to do is call to mind the place you're familiar with. Your home, your route to school, or your favorite restaurant and voila in the blink of an imaginative eye this becomes the memory palace that you'll use as your notepad.

![](http://okye062gb.bkt.clouddn.com/2017-02-09-063915.jpg)

The memory palace technique is useful for remembering unrelated items, such as a grocery list. Milk, bread, eggs. To use the technique, you might imagine a gigantic bottle of milk just inside your front door. The bread plopped on the couch and a cracked egg dribbling off the edge of the coffee table. In other words, you'd imagine yourself walking through a place you know well, coupled with shockingly memorable images of what you want to remember. If you're studying Finance, Sociology, Chemistry or what have you, and you have lists to remember, you could use this same approach. The first time you do this, it will be slow. It takes a bit of time to conjure up a solid mental image. But the more you do it, the quicker it becomes.

![](http://okye062gb.bkt.clouddn.com/2017-02-09-063940.jpg)

One study showed that a person using the Memory Palace technique could remember more than 95% of a 40 to 50 item list after only one or two practice mental walks, where the items were placed on the grounds of the local university. In using the mind this way, memorization can become an outstanding exercise in creativity that simultaneously build neural hooks for even more creativity. **Purists might sniff that using oddball memorization gimmicks isn't really learning. But researchers show that students who use this kind of tricks outperform those who don't. In addition, imaging research on how people become experts, shows that such memory tools speed up the acquisition of both chunks and big picture templates. Helping transform novices to semi experts much more quickly, even in a matter of weeks.**


**Memory tricks allow people to expand their working memory with easy access to long term memory. What's more, the memory process itself becomes an exercise in creativity. The more you memorize using these innovative techniques, the more creative you become. This is because you're building these wild, unexpected possibilities for future connections early on. Even as you're first internalizing the ideas, the more you practice this type of memory muscle so to speak, the more easily you'll be able to remember.** Where at first it may take 15 minutes to build an evocative image for an equation and embed it say, in the kitchen sink of your memory palace, it can later take only minutes or seconds to perform a similar task. You'll also realize that as you begin to internalize key aspects of the material, taking a little time to commit the most important points to memory, you come to understand it much more deeply. The formulas will mean far more to you, than they would if you simply looked them up in a book. And you'll be able to sling those formulas around much more proficiently on tests and in real world applications. You may say, well, you're just not that creative, an equation or theory could hardly have its own grandiose motivations or persnickeity emotional needs to help you understand and remember it. But always remember, your childlike creativity is still there inside you. You just need to reach out to it.


##Summing Up Memory

Learning to use your memory in a more disciplined yet creative manner helps you learn to focus your attention, even as you create wild diffuse connections that build stronger memories. Here are the key ideas about memory we've covered:

- In this course, we discussed two main memory systems involved in your ability to chunk concepts. The first is long term memory, which is like a storage warehouse. You need to practice and repeat in order to help store items in long term memory so you can retrieve them more easily. Practicing and repeating, all in one day, is a bad idea. You want to extend your practice to several days. This is why tackling procrastination is important. It helps you build better memories because you start earlier. The second, is working memory, which is like a poor blackboard that quickly fades. You can only hold about four items in your working memory. When you master a technique or concept in some sense, it compacts the ideas so they can occupy less space in your working memory when you do bring them to mind. This frees your mental thinking space so that it can more easily grapple with other ideas.

- We have outstanding visual and spatial memory systems. If you tap into（深入了解） those systems, it will help improve your memory. To begin tapping into your visual memory system, try making a very memorable visual image representing one key item you want to remember. Beyond merely seeing, try to feel, to hear and even to smell something you're trying to remember. The funnier and more evocative the image is, the better. As always, repetition over several days is really helpful.

- Another key to memorization is to create meaningful groups that simplify the material. Try associating numbers with years or with systems you're familiar with like running times. Many disciplines use memorable sentences. The memory palace technique, placing memorable images in a scene that's familiar to you, allows you to dip into the strength of your visual memory system, providing a particularly powerful way of grouping things you want to remember. By making meaningful groups and abbreviations, you can simplify and chunk what you're trying to learn so you can more easily store it in memory. And by memorizing material you understand, you can internalize the material in a profound（巨大的） way. You're reinforcing the mental library you need to become a genuine master of the material.
