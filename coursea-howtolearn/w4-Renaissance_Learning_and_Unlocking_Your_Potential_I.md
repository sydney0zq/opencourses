##How to Become a Better Learner

Welcome back to Learning How to Learn. Today we're going to talk about how to become a better learner. As we learn more about the brain we can become better learners, and here are two tips for how to learn better.

**Tip number one – the best gift that you can give your brain is Physical Exercise. We once thought that all of the neurons in your brain were already present at birth, but we now know that in a few places, new neurons are born every day.** One of these places is in your Hippocampus, a brain area that is very important for learning new things that we already discussed earlier in the course. In this experiment, a rat is shown, learning how to distinguish a picture of a flower from a picture of an airplane. In the background is a photo of neurons in the hippocampus, with the old neurons shown in blue and newly generated neurons in red. As the rat learns the task, these new neurons are recruited to help perform better pattern separation between the two pictures. **These new neurons help you learn new things but they will die if you don't use them. New experiences will rescue them.（新的学习经历能帮助它们存活下来）**


**Exercise, interestingly, also helps new neurons survive. Exercise is by far, more effective than any drug on the market today to help you learn better. It benefits all of your vital organisms, not just your brain. It is unfortunate that schools are dropping gym and recess to make room for more instruction. Gym and recess are by far the most important parts of the curriculum.**

**Here's another tip – and this has to do with practice making perfect, but only when your brain is prepared. There are certain critical periods in the development of your brain. When sudden improvements occur in specific abilities, expect them to happen and prepare your brain for them. The critical period for first language acquisition extends up to puberty（青春期）. One of the best studied critical periods in the brain is when binocular depth perception or stereopsis matures during the first two years of life.** Stereopsis is the magic behind Magic Eye pictures like the one shown here. If you stare at this image and slightly cross your eyes, you will see staircases（楼梯） pop out of the page. There is a slight shift between the images in the two eyes and your brain interprets this slight shift as difference in depth. Not everyone, however, can see this. Over 5% of the population is stereo（立体） blind. **If the two eyes are not properly aligned during the first two years of development, the neurons in your visual cortex will fail to properly strengthen the inputs from the two eyes and depth perception is permanently impaired.** Well, that's the dogma. Sue Barry, a friend of mine from graduate school at Princeton, was able to recover stereo vision through eye exercises, and wrote a book about it, entitled Fixing My Gaze, a Scientist's Journey Into Seeing in Three Dimensions.

**Practice can repair, as well as train the brain. But this takes much longer, past the critical period. This brings us to zombies. Zombies can't learn. It is also clear from their behavior that they have brain damage. Especially in the front of their cortex, which is the part that makes plans, as well as in their language areas. Learning, planning, language, these are the skills that make us human. The prefrontal cortex is also involved in complex analysis in social behaviors, as well as decision making and planning. It is the last part of the cortex to mature, so until this happens, there may be a little bit of zombie in you.**


Another patient, EVR, suffered a stroke in the social parts of his prefrontal cortex. EVR had a high IQ and seemed normal, but he was ruined by making bad financial decisions and bad social interactions. He lost both his home and his family. **Good judgement takes a long time, and a lot of experience to acquire. Learning is too important to be left behind in the classroom. Learning to learn is a skill you can master, and you can use it to improve every part of your life.** You'll be learning even more learning tips this week, and can follow up on them at <http://www.brainfacts.org/>.

##Introduction to Renaissance Learning and Unlocking Your Potential

![](http://okye062gb.bkt.clouddn.com/2017-02-09-094009.jpg)

This week we are going to wrap up a slew of important ideas, and techniques that will help round out and enhance your ability to learn well, using metaphors and analogies, to work profitable with teammates, and not undercut your own strengths, and finally to perform well on tests.


**One important thought though, before we launch into this week's videos, learning doesn't progress logically, so that each day just adds an additional neat package to your knowledge shelf. Sometimes you hit a wall in constructing your understanding. Things that made sense before can suddenly seem confusing. This type of knowledge collapse seems to occur when your mind is restructuring its understanding, building a more solid foundation. In the case of language learners, they experience occasional periods when the foreign language suddenly seems completely incomprehensible. Remember it takes time to assimilate（吸收） new knowledge. You'll inevitably go through some periods when you seem to take and exasperating step backwards, in your understanding. This is a natural phenomenon, that means that your mind is wrestling deeply with the material. You'll find that when you emerge from these periods of temporary frustration, your knowledge base will take a surprising leap forward.**


##Create a Lively Visual Metaphor of Analogy

**One of the best things you can do to not only remember, but understand concepts, is to create a metaphor or analogy for them; often the more visual the better.** A metaphor is just a way of realizing that one thing is somehow similar to another. Simple ideas like one geography teacher's description of Syria is shaped like a bowl of cereal（谷物）, and Jordan as a Nike Air Jordan sneaker, can stick with a student for decades. If you're trying to understand electrical current, it can help to visualize it as water. Similarly, electrical voltage can feel like pressure, a push. As you climb to a more sophisticated understanding of whatever topic you're concentrating on, you can revise your metaphors or toss them away and create more meaningful ones.

Metaphors and visualization, being able to see something in your mind's eye, have been especially helpful not only in art and literature, but also in allowing the scientific and engineering world to make progress. In the 1800s for example, when chemists began to imagine and visualize the miniature world of molecules, dramatic progress began to be made. Here's a fun illustration of monkeys in a benzene ring from an insider spoof of German Academic Chemical Life printed in 1886. Note the single bonds, or the monkeys' hands, and the double bonds with their tiny little tails.

It's often helpful to pretend that you are the concept you're trying to understand. Put yourself in an electron's warm and fuzzy slippers as it burrows through a slab of copper. Or sneak inside the X of an algebraic equation and feel what it's like to poke your head out of the rabbit hole. But just don't let it get exploded by an inadvertent divide by zero. In chemistry, compare a Cation with a cat that has paws and is therefore pawsitive. And an Anion with an onion that's negative, because it makes you cry. **Metaphors are never perfect, but then in science, all models are just metaphors which means they break down at some point. But never mind that. Metaphors and models are often vitally important in giving a physical understanding of the central idea behind the process or concept you are trying to understand. Interestingly, metaphors and analogies are useful for getting people out of Einstellung（定势）, that is, being blocked by thinking about a problem in the wrong way.** For example, telling a simple story of soldiers attacking a fortress from many different directions at once can open creative paths for students to see how many low-intensity rays can be effectively used to destroy a cancerous tumor. Stories, even if they're just used as silly memory tricks, can also allow you to more easily retain what you're trying to learn. Metaphors also help glue an idea into your mind because they make a connection to neural structures that are already there. It's like being able to trace a pattern with tracing paper. **Metaphors at least help you get a sense of what's going on.**

##No Need for Genius Envy

This is a good place for us to step back and look again at chunking from another perspective. Notice what we're doing here. We're interleaving our learning by jumping back to revisit and deepen our understanding of a topic we've already covered.
**There's an interesting connection between learning math and science and learning a sport.** In baseball, for example, you don't learn how to hit in one day. Instead, your body perfects your swing from lots and lots of repetition over a period of years. Smooth repetition creates muscle memory, so your body knows what to do from a single thought, one chunk, instead of having to recall all the complex steps involved in hitting a ball. In the same way, once you understand why you do something in math and science, you don't have to keep re-explaining the how to yourself every time you do it. It's not necessary to go around with a hundred beans in your pocket and to lay out ten rows of ten beans again and again so you get that ten times ten is equal to 100. At some point you just know it from memory.


For example you memorize the idea that you simply add exponents, those little superscript numbers, when you are multiplying numbers that have the same base. Ten to the fourth times ten to the fifth is equal to ten to the ninth. **If you use the procedure a lot, by doing many different types of problems you'll find that you understand both the why and the how behind the procedure far better then you do after getting a conventional explanation from a teacher or a book. The greater understanding results from the fact that your mind constructed the patterns of meaning, rather than simply accepting what someone else has told you. Remember, people learn by trying to make sense out of the information they perceive. They rarely learn anything complex simply by having someone else tell it to them.**


Chess masters, emergency room physicians, fighter pilots, and many other experts often have to make complex decisions rapidly. **They shut down their conscious system and instead rely on their well-trained intuition, drawing on their deeply ingrained repertoire of chunks. At some point self-consciously understanding why you do what you do, just slows you down and interrupts the flow resulting in worse decisions.** But wait, are chess masters and people who can multiply six digit numbers in their heads exceptionally gifted? Not necessarily. I'm going to tell it to you straight. Sure intelligence matters. Being smarter often equates to having a larger working memory. **Your hot rod of a memory may be able to hold nine things in mind instead of four and you can latch on to those things like a bulldog, which makes it easier to learn. But guess what, it also makes it more difficult for you to be creative. How's that? It's our old friend and enemy Einstellung.**


The idea you are already holding in mind can block you from fresh thoughts. A superb working memory can hold its thoughts so tightly that new thoughts can't easily peek through. Such tightly controlled attention could use an occasional whiff of ADHD-like（像注意力不集中症） fresh air, the ability, in other words, to have your attention shift even if you don't want it to shift. **If you're one of those people who can't hold a lot in mind at once, you lose focus and start daydreaming in lectures and have to get to some place quiet to focus so you can use your working memory to its maximum, well welcome to the clan of the creative.** Having a somewhat smaller working memory means you can more easily generalize your learning into new, more creative combinations. **Because your working memory, which grows from the focusing abilities of the prefrontal cortex doesn't lock everything up so tightly. You can more easily get input from other parts of your brain. These other areas, which include the sensory cortex, not only are more in tune with what's going on around you in the environment, but are also the source of dreams, not to mention creative ideas. You may have to work harder sometimes or even much of the time to understand what's going on. But once you get something chunked you can take that chunk and turn it outside in and inside round, putting it through creative paces even you didn't think you were capable of.**

![](http://okye062gb.bkt.clouddn.com/2017-02-09-154119.jpg)

Here's another point to put into your mental chunker: **it is practice, particularly deliberate practice on the toughest aspects of the material that can help lift average brains into the realm of those with more natural gifts.** Just as you can practice lifting weights and get bigger muscles over time, you can also practice certain mental patterns that deepen and enlarge in your mind. Whether you’re naturally gifted or you have to struggle to get a solid grasp of the fundamentals, you should realize that you're not alone if you think you're an imposter. That it's a fluke when you happen to do well on a test, and then on the next test, for sure they, and your family and friends, are finally going to figure out how incompetent you really are. This feeling is so extraordinarily common that it even has a name – The Imposter Syndrome（冒充者综合症）. If you suffer from these kinds of feelings of inadequacy just be aware that many others secretly share them. **Everyone has different gifts, as the old saying goes, when one door closes, another opens. Keep your chin up and your eye on the open door.**


##Change Your Thoughts Change Your Life

I love reading history and being inspired by the biographies of extraordinary people. One of the most unusual people I've ever read about, is inspiring not only because he was so extraordinary, but also, because he was so ordinary.


Santiago Ramón y Cajal was a born troublemaker. In rural Spain of the 1860s, there weren't many options for oddball juvenile delinquents. So that's how at 11 years old, Cajal found himself in jail. Cajal was stubborn and rebellious（固执并且叛逆）. Who knew that Santiago Ramón y Cajal would one day not only earn the Nobel Prize, but eventually become known as the Father of Modern Neuroscience?

![](http://okye062gb.bkt.clouddn.com/2017-02-09-155934.jpg)

Cajal was already in his early 20s when he began climbing from bad boy delinquency into the traditional study of medicine. **There's evidence that myelin sheaths, the fatty insulation that helps signals move more quickly along a neuron, don't finish developing in some people until they're in their twenties. This may explain why teenagers often have trouble controlling their impulsive behavior.** The wiring between the intention and the control areas of the brain isn't completely formed. When you use neural circuits however, it seems you help build the myelin sheath over them; not to mention making many other microscopic changes. Practice appears to strengthen and reinforce connections between different brain regions, creating highways between the brain's control centers and the centers that store knowledge. In Cajal's case, it seems his natural maturation processes coupled with his own efforts to develop his thinking, helped him to take control of his overall behavior. **It seems people can enhance the development of their neuronal circuits by practicing thoughts that use those neurons. We're still in the infancy of understanding neural development. One thing is becoming clear, we can make significant changes in our brain by changing how we think.**

![](http://okye062gb.bkt.clouddn.com/2017-02-09-155950.jpg)

Cajal met and worked with many brilliant scientists through his lifetime. People who were often far smarter than he. In Cajal's autobiography however, **he pointed out that although brilliant people can do exceptional work, just like anyone else they can also be careless and biased. Cajal felt the key to his own success was his perseverance（不屈不挠）. What he called the virtue of the less brilliant, coupled with his flexible ability to change his mind and admit errors. Anyone, Cajal noted, even people with average intelligence, can change their own brains so that even the least gifted can produce an abundant harvest（丰硕的结果）.**


People like Charles Darwin, whose theory of evolution has made him one of the most influential figures in human history, are often thought of as these, sort of, natural geniuses. You may be surprised to learn that much like Cajal, Darwin was a poor student in school. He washed out of medical school and ended up, to his father's horror, heading out on a round the world voyage as the ship's naturalist. Out on his own, Darwin was able to look with fresh eyes at the data he was collecting. **Approaching material with a goal of learning it on your own, can give you a unique path to mastery. Often no matter how good your teacher and textbook are, it's only when you sneak off and look at other books or videos that you begin to see what you learn through a single teacher, or book, is a partial version of the full three dimensional reality of the subject, which has links to still other fascinating topics that are of your choosing. Taking responsibility for your own learning is one of the most important things you can do.**


Santiago Ramón y Cajal had a deep understanding, not only of how to conduct science but also of how people just interact with one another. **He warned fellow learners that there will always be those who criticize or attempt to undermine any effort or achievement you make. This happens to everybody; not just Nobel Prize winners. If you do well in your studies, the people around you can feel threatened. The greater your achievement, the more other people will sometimes attack and demean your efforts. On the other hand, if you flunk a test, you also may encounter critics who throw more barbs, saying you don't have what it takes.**


We're often told that empathy is universally beneficial. But it's not. **It's important to learn to switch on an occasional cool dispassion that helps you to not only focus on what you're trying to learn, but also to tune people out if you discover that their interests lie in undercutting you. Such undercutting is all too common, as people are often just as competitive as they are cooperative. When you're a young person, mastering such dispassion can be difficult. We're naturally excited about what we're working on, and we like to believe that everyone can be reasoned with and then, almost everyone is naturally good hearted towards us. Like Santiago Ramón y Cajal, you can take pride in aiming for success. Because of the very things that make other people say you can't do it. Take pride in who you are. Especially, in the qualities that make you different, and use them as a secret talisman for success. Use your natural contrariness to defy the always present prejudices from others about what you can accomplish.**
