##A Procrastination Preview

Everybody has some issues with procrastination（拖延）. **Because if you're working on something, it means you're not working, on a lot of other things.** But some people have more issues with procrastination than others. In this video, we're going to give you a little insight into procrastination. Why it arises, and a powerful little tool to help you address it.

When you look at something that you really rather not do（不愿意做）, it seems that you activate the areas of your brain associated with pain. Your brain, naturally enough, looks for a way to stop that negative stimulation by switching your attention to something else. **But here's the trick. Researchers discovered that not long after people might start actually working out what they didn't like, that neuro-discomfort disappeared.（这种神经上的不适很快就消失）** So it seems what happens when you procrastinate, is something like this; first, you observe, and get a cue about something that causes a tiny bit of unease. You don't like it, so to make the sensation go away you turn your attention from whatever caused that unease. You turn toward something more pleasant. The result, you feel happier, temporarily.

We're going to talk more about procrastination later on. But in the mean, time I'm going to let you in on a handy little mental tool. This tool is called, the Pomodoro. It was invented by Francesco Cirillo, in the early 1980's. **Pomodoro is Italian for tomato. The timer you use often looks like a tomato and really, a timer is all there is to this elegant little technique. All you need to do, is set a timer to 25 minutes, turn off all interruptions, and then focus. That's it! Most anybody can focus for 25 minutes. The only last important thing is to give yourself a little reward when you're done.** A few minutes of web surfing, a cup of coffee, or a bite of chocolate, even just stretching or chatting mindlessly, allowing your brain to enjoyably change its focus for a while. You'll find that using the Pomodoro technique is very effective. It's a little like doing an intense 25 minute workout at a mental gym. Followed by some mental relaxation. Give it a try.

##Practice Makes PermanentYep, that's me when I was 10. I loved animals, handicrafts（手工艺）, and dreaming. Back then, I was the belligerent（好斗的） queen of anti-math. I neglected（疏忽）, ignored, flunked（考试不及格）, and downright hated math and science all through grade school, middle school, and high school. It's strange to realize I'm now a professor of Engineering. I enlisted（从军） in the army right out of high school to study language at the Defense Language Institute. That's me at 18, looking very nervous and very focused while throwing a hand grenade（手榴弹）.

I only started to study math and science when I was 26 years old, after I got out of the military. At first, it was really hard. There were all these quick thinkers in my classes who seemed to get everything a lot easier and faster than me. Sometimes I'd take a break for a few months, I'd go out and work as a Russian translator on Soviet trawlers. That's me up in the Bering Sea（白令海峡）. And I'd come back to school and try and learn some more. As I gained technical know-how, new doors started opening up for me. I ended up working as a radio operator at the South Pole Station in Antarctica. That's where I met my husband. I always say I had to go the end of the Earth to meet that man. Here he is, after only 10 minutes outside at minus 70 degrees Fahrenheit with a 60-mile-an-hour wind. The wind chill（寒冷） takes it off the charts.

Now, I wasn't natural in math and science. Not at all. The way I succeeded was to gradually begin to figure out some tricks. But let's back up a step. **In the greater scheme of all the different careers and disciplines that people can pursue（追逐）, why are those involving math and science, sometimes, a bit more challenging（更具挑战）?** We think it may be related, at least in part, to the abstract nature of the ideas. I mean, let's take a cow for example, out standing in a field. If you have the word cow, you can point right to a cow to learn what that word means. Even the letters for the word cow, C-O-W, are roughly analogous to sounds that they stand for. But for mathematical ideas, there's often no analogous thing that you can point to. There are no plus signs standing out in a field. No multiplication, division, or other kinds of things that can directly equate to mini mathematical or scientific terms. These terms are more abstract, in other words. **Well, you might say, yeah, but what about ones like love, zest（热情）, or hope? Those are all abstract. Yes they are, but the thing is, these abstract terms are often related to our emotions. We can feel our emotions, even if we can't see and point to concrete examples, like we could with the cow.** This means it's important to practice with ideas and concepts your learning in math and science, just like anything else you’re learning to help enhance and strengthen the neural connection you’re making during the learning process.

You can see on your left here the symbolic representation of a thought pattern. Neurons become linked together through repeated use. **The more abstract something is, the more important it is to practice in order to bring those ideas into reality for you. Even if the ideas you're dealing with are abstract, the neural thought patterns you are creating are real and concrete. At least they are if you build and strengthen them through practice.**

Here's a way to picture what's going on. When you first begin to understand something, for example, how to solve a problem, the neural pattern from is there, but very weak. Kind of like the faint（微弱的） pattern at the top of our paintball machine analogy here. When you solve the problem again fresh from the start, without looking at the solution, you begin deepening that neuron pattern, kind of like the darker pattern you see here in the middle. And when you have the problem down cold, so you can go over each step completely and concisely in your mind without even looking at the solution, and you've even had practice on related problems, why then, the pattern is like this dark firm pattern you can see towards the bottom of the pinball frame. **Practice makes permanent.**

**When you're learning, what you want to do is study something. Study it hard by focusing intently（专注的）. Then take a break or at least change your focus to something different for a while. During this time of seeming relaxation, your brain's diffuse mode has a chance to work away in the background and help you out with your conceptual understanding. Your neural mortar in some sense has a chance to dry. If you don't do this, if instead you learn by cramming（硬塞）, your knowledge base will look more like this, all in a jumble with everything confused, a poor foundation. If you have problems with procrastination, that's when you want to use the Pomodoro, that brief timer. This helps you get going, using brief periods each day of focused attention that will help you start building the neural patterns you need to be more successful in learning more challenging materials.** Next, we'll be talking about chunking, the vital essence of how you grasp and master key ideas.


##Introduction to MemoryWhen I look back on my childhood or I remember some words from Spanish or from Russian, Здравствуйте, or I bring to mind one of Maxwell's equations, I'm drawing on portions of my brain involved in long term memory. But what I'm trying to hold a few ideas in mind to connect them together so I can understand a concept or solve a problem, I'm using my working memory. Obviously, sometimes I'll bring something from my long term memory into my working memory, so I can think about it. **So the two types of memory are related. There are lots of different ways to slice our understanding a memory, but for this course on learning, we're going to talk about only these two major memory systems, working memory and long term memory.**

Working memory is the part of memory that has to do with what you're immediately and consciously processing in your mind. Your working memory is centered out of the prefrontal cortex, although as we'll see later, there are also connections to other parts of your brain, so you can access long term memories. Researchers used to think that our working memory could hold around seven items or chunks, but now it's widely believed that the working memory is holds only about four chunks of information. **We tend to automatically group memory items in to chunks so it seems our working memory is bigger than it actually is. Although your working memory is like a blackboard, it's not a very good blackboard. You often need to keep repeating what you are trying to work with so it's stays in your working memory. For example, you'll sometimes repeat a phone number to yourself until you have a chance to write it down. Repetition is needed so that your metabolic vampires, that is, natural dissipating processes, don't suck those memories away. You may find yourself shutting yours eyes to keep any other items from intruding into the limited slots of your working memory as you concentrate.**

So we know that short term memory is something like an inefficient mental blackboard. **The other form of memory, long term memory, is like a storage warehouse. And just like a warehouse, it's distributed over a big area. Different kinds of long term memories are stored in different regions of the brain. Research has shown when you first try to put a short term memory in long term memory, you need to revisit it at least a few times to increase the chances that you'll be able to find later when you might need it. The long term memory storage warehouse is immense（巨大的）. It's got room for billions of items. In fact, there can be so many items they can bury（掩盖） each other, so it can be difficult for you to find the information you need unless you practice and repeat at least a few times.**
**Long term memory is important because it's where you store fundamental concepts and techniques that are often involved in whatever you're learning about. When you encounter something new, you often use your working memory to handle it. If you want to move that information into your long term memory, it often takes time and practice. To help with this process, use a technique called spaced repetition. This technique involves repeating what you're trying to retain（保留）, but what you want to do is space this repetition out. Repeating a new vocabulary word or a problem solving technique, for example, over a number of days. Extending your practice over several days does make a difference.**

Research has shown that if you try to glue things into your memory by repeating something 20 times in one evening, for example, it won't stick nearly as well as if you practice it the same number of times over several days. This is like building the brick wall we saw earlier. If you don't leave time for the mortar to dry, that is, time for the synoptic connections to form and strengthen, you won't have a very good structure. 



##The Importance of Sleep in LearningYou might be surprised to learn that just plain being awake creates toxic products in your brain. How does the brain get rid of these poisons? Turns out that when you sleep, your brain cells shrink. This causes an increase in the space between your brain cells. It's like unblocking a stream. Fluid can flow past these cells and wash the toxins out. So sleep, which can sometimes seem like such a waste of time, is actually your brain's way of keeping itself clean and healthy.

![](http://okye062gb.bkt.clouddn.com/2017-02-07-135240.jpg)
So, let's get right to a critical idea. Taking a test without getting enough sleep means you're operating with a brain that's got little metabolic toxins floating around in it. Poisons that make it so you can't think very clearly. It's kind of like trying to drive a car that's got sugar in its gas tank. Doesn't work too well. In fact, getting too little sleep doesn't just make you do worse on tests, too little sleep, over too long of a time, can also be associated with all sorts of nasty Conditions, including headaches, depression, heart disease, diabetes, and just plain dying earlier.

**But sleep does more than just allow your brain to wash away toxins. It's actually important part of the memory and learning process. It's seems that during sleep your brain tidies up ideas and concepts your thinking about and learning. It erases the less important parts of memories and simultaneously strengthens areas that you need or want to remember. During sleep your brain also rehearses some of the tougher parts of whatever you're trying to learn, going over and over neural patterns to deepen and strengthen them. Sleep has also been shown to make a remarkable difference in your ability to figure out difficult problems and to understand what you're trying to learn. It's as if the complete deactivation of the conscious you in the pre- frontal cortex at the forefront of your brain helps other areas of your brain start talking more easily to one another, allowing them to put together the neural solution to your learning task while you're sleeping.**

Of course, you must also plant the seed for your diffuse mode by first doing focused mode work. If you're going over what you're learning right before you take a nap or going to sleep for the evening you have an increased chance of dreaming about it. If you go even further and set it in mind that you want to dream about the material, it seems to improve your chances of dreaming about it still further. Dreaming about what you're studying can substantially enhance your ability to understand. It somehow consolidates your memories into easier to grasp chunks.
