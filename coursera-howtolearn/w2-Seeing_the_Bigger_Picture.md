##What Motivates You?
Welcome back! It is hard to learn when you're not into it. But if it's something you're really interested in, learning is easy. Why is that?

Most of the neurons in your cortex carry information about what is happening around you and what you're doing. **Your brain also has a set of diffusely projecting systems of neuromodulators, that carry information not about the content of an experience but it's importance and value to your future, neuromodulators（神经递质） are chemicals that influence how a neurons responds to other neurons.** And today we will discuss three of them. Acetylcholine（乙酰胆碱）, Dopamine（多巴胺） and Serotonin（血清素）.

Acetylcholine neurons form neuromodulatory connections to the cortex that are particularly important for focused learning, when you are paying close attention. These acetylcholine neurons project widely and activate circuits that control synaptic plasticity（可塑性）. Leading to new long term memory.

Neuromodulators also have a profound impact on your unconscious mind.**One of the great brain discoveries in my life time, has been that our motivation is controlled by a particular chemical substance called Dopamine.** Which is found in a small set of neurons in our brain stem shown here in orange. These dopamine neurons are part of a large brain system that controls reward learning and in particular in the basal ganglia, which is located in the green region above the dopamine neurons and below the cortex at the top of the brain. Dopamine is released from these neurons, when we receive an unexpected reward. Dopamine signals project widely and have a very powerful effect on learning. And this is something that also affects decision-making. And even the value of sensory inputs.

This can motivate you to do something that may not be rewarding right now but will lead to a much better reward in the future. _Addictive drugs artificially increase dopamine activity and fool your brain into thinking that something wonderful has just happened. In fact just the opposite has just happened. This leads to craving and dependence, which can hijack your free will and can motivate actions that are harmful to you._ Loss of Dopamine neurons leads to a lack of motivation; and something called anhedonia（快感缺乏）, which is a loss of interest in things that once gave you pleasure. Severe loss of Dopamine neurons causes resting tremor, slowness, rigidity, this is called Parkinson's disease. Ultimately it leads to catatonia（紧张症）, a complete lack of any movement. Dopamine neurons are part of the unconscious part of your brain that you learned about in the first week. When you promise to treat yourself something after a study section you are tapping into your dopamine system.**

**Serotonin is a third diffuse neuromodulatory system that strongly affects your social life.** In monkey troops the alpha male has the highest level of serotonin activity and the lowest ranking male has the lowest levels. Prozac, which is prescribed for clinical depression, raises the level of Serotonin activity. The level of Serotonin is also closely linked to risk taking behavior. With higher risk in lower Serotonin monkeys. Inmates in jail for violent crimes have some of the lowest levels of serotonin activity in society. Finally your emotions strongly affect learning as you are well aware. **Emotions were once thought to be separate from cognition（认知） but recent research has shown that emotions are intertwined with perception and attention and interact with learning and memory.** The amygdala an almond shaped structure shown here, nestled down at the base of the brain is one of the major centers where cognition and emotion are effectively integrated. The amygdala is part of the limbic system which together with hippocampus is involved in processing memory and decision making as well as regulating emotional reactions. You will want to keep your amygdala happy to be an effective learner. **The emotions and your neuromodulatory systems are slower than perception and action but are no less important for successful learning.** If you want to learn more about Acetylcholine, Dopamine, and Serotonin, look them on www.brainfacts.org, a website that is filled with valuable facts about your brain.



## The Value of a Library of Chunks

The ability to combine chunks in new and original ways underlies（位于...之下） a lot of historical innovation. Bill Gates and other industry leaders set aside（留出） extended week-long reading periods so that they can hold many and varied ideas in mind during onetime. This helps generate their own innovative thinking by allowing fresh in mind not yet forgotten ideas to network amongst themselves.

**Basically what people do to enhance their knowledge and gain expertise is to gradually build the number of chunks in their mind.** Valuable bits of information,they can piece together in new and creative ways. Chess masters, for example, can easily access thousands of different chess patterns. Musicians, linguists andscientists can each access similar chunks of knowledge in their own disciplines. The bigger and more well practiced your chunked mental library, whatever the subject you're learning, the more easily you'll be able to solve problems and figure outsolutions. As we'll discover soon, **chunking isn't all you'll need to develop creative flexibility in your learning. But it's an important component.**

**Chunks can also help you understand new concepts.** This is because when you grasp one chunk, you'll find that that chunk can be related in surprising ways to similar chunks, not only in that field, but also in very different fields. This idea is called transfer. For example, concepts and problems solving methods you learned for physics can be very similar to chunked concepts in business. I've found some aspects of language learning were very helpful for me when I later began to learn Computer Programming.

**A chunk is a way of compressing information much more compactly.** As you gain more experience in chunking in particular subject, you'll see that the chunks you're able to create are bigger. In some sense, that the ribbons（带状物） are longer. Not only are those ribbons longer but the neural patterns are in some sense darker. They're more solid and firmly in grained. If you have a library of concepts and solutions internalized as chunked patterns, you can think of it as a collection or a library of neural patterns. When you're trying to figure something out, if you have a good library of these chunks, you can more easily skip to the right solution by metaphorically speaking, listening to whispers from your diffuse mode. Your diffuse mode can help you connect two or more chunks together in new ways to solve novelproblems. Another way to think of it is this. As you build each chunk, it is filling in a part of your larger knowledge picture. But if you don't practice with your growing chunks, they can remain faint, and it's harder to put together the big picture of what you're trying to learn. In building a chunked library, you're training your brain to recognize not only a specific concept, but different types and classes of concepts so that you can automatically know how to solve quickly or handle whatever you encounter. You'll start to see patterns that simplify problem solving for you and will soon find that different solution techniques are lurking（潜藏） at the edge of your memory. Before midterms or finals it can be easy to brush up and have these solutions at the mental ready.

**There are two ways to figure something out or to solve problems. First there's sequential step by step reasoning, and second through a more holistic intuition. Sequential thinking, where each small step leads deliberately towards a solution,involves the focused mode. Intuition on the other hand often seems to require this creative diffuse mode linking of several seemingly different focused mode thoughts. Most difficult problems and concepts are grasped through intuition, because these new ideas make a leap away from what you're familiar with. Keep in mind that the diffuse mode's semi-random way of making connections means that the solutions they provide should be very carefully verified using the focused mode. Intuitive insights aren't always correct. You may think there are so many problems and concepts, just in a single section or chapter of whatever you're studying, there's just no way to learn them all. This is where the law of serendipity（机遇） comes into play. Lady luck favors the one who tries. Just focus on whatever section you're studying. You'll find that once you put that first problem or concept in your mental library, whatever it is, then the second concept will go in a little more easily. And the third more easily still. Not that all of this is a snap, but it does get easier.**



## Overlearning, Chocking, Einstellung, and Interleaving

When you're learning a new idea, for example a new vocabulary word or a new concept or a new problem solving approach, you sometimes tend to practice it over and over again during the same study session. A little of this is useful and necessary, but continuing to study or practice after you've mastered what you can in the session is called overlearning.

![](http://okye062gb.bkt.clouddn.com/2017-02-08-091636.jpg)

**Overleaning can have its place. It can produce an automaticity that can be important when you're executing a serve in tennis or a perfect piano concerto.** If you choke on tests or public speaking, overlearning can be especially valuable. Do you know that even expert public speakers practice on the order of 70 hours for atypical 20-minute TED Talk? Automaticity can indeed be helpful in times of nervousness, but be wary（警惕） of repetitive overlearning during a single session. **Research has shown it can be a waste of valuable learning time. The reality is, once you've got the basic idea down during a session, continuing to hammer away at it during the same session doesn't strengthen the kinds of long term memory connections you want to have strengthened. Worse yet, focusing on one technique is a little like learning carpentry by only practicing with a hammer. After a while youthink you can fix anything by just bashing at it.**


**Using a subsequent study session to repeat what you're trying to learn is just fine and often valuable. It can strengthen and deepen your chunked neuron patterns. But be wary; repeating something you already know perfectly well, is, face it, easy. It can also bring the illusion of competence that you've mastered the full range of material, when you've actually only mastered the easy stuff. Instead, you want to balance your studies by deliberately focusing on what you find more difficult. This focusing on the more difficult material is called deliberate practice. It's often what makes the difference between a good student and a great student.**

![](http://okye062gb.bkt.clouddn.com/2017-02-08-094123.jpg)

**All this is also related to a concept known as Einstellung（刻意训练）. In this phenomenon, your initial simple thought, an idea you already have in mind or a neural pattern you've already developed and strengthened, may prevent a better idea or solution from being found. We saw this in the focus pinball picture, where your initial pinball of thought went to the upper part of the brain, but the solution thought pattern was inthe lower part. The crowded bumpers of the focus mode and the previous patterns you built can create a sort of rut that prevents you from springing to a new place where the solution might be found.**

![](http://okye062gb.bkt.clouddn.com/2017-02-08-094225.jpg)

Incidentally, the German word einstellung means mindset. Basically you can remember einstellung as installing a roadblock because of the way you were initially looking at something. This kind of wrong approach is especially easy to do in sports and science, not to mention other disciplines, because sometimes your initial intuition about what's happening or what you need to be doing is misleading. You have to unlearn your erroneous older ideas or approaches even while you're learning new ones.


**One significant mistake students sometimes make in learning is jumping into the water before they learn to swim. In other words, they blindly start working on homework without reading the textbook, attending lectures, viewing online lessons, or even speaking with someone knowledgeable. This is a recipe for sinking. It's likerandomly allowing a thought to, kind of pop off in the focus mode pinball machine, without paying any real attention to where the solution truly lies. Understanding how to obtain real solutions is important in learning and in life. Mastering a new subject means learning not only the basic chunks, but also learning how to select and use different chunks. The best way to learn that is by practicing jumping back and forth between problems or situations that require different techniques or strategies. This is called interleaving. Once you have the basic idea of the technique down during your study session, sort of like learning to ride a bike with training wheels, start interleaving your practice with problems of different types or different types of approaches, concepts, procedures. Sometimes this can be a little tough to do. A given section in a book, for example, is often devoted to a specific technique, so when you flip to that section you already know which technique you're going to be using. Still, do what you can to mix up your learning.**


In science and math in particular it can help to look ahead at the more varied problem sets that are sometimes found at the end of chapters. Or you can deliberately try to make yourself occasionally pick out why some problems call for one technique as opposed to another. You want your brain to become used to the idea that just knowing how to use a particular concept, approach, or problem-solving technique isn't enough. You also need to know when to use it. Interleaving your studies, making it a point to review for a test, for example, by skipping around through problems in the different chapters and materials can sometimes seem to make your learning a little more difficult, but in reality, it helps you learn more deeply.


**Interleaving is extraordinarily important. Although practice and repetition is important in helping build solid neural patterns to draw on, it's interleaving that starts building flexibility and creativity. It's where you leave the world of practice and repetition, and begin thinking more independently. When you interleave within one subject or one discipline, you begin to develop your creative power within that discipline. When you interleave between several subjects or disciplines, you can more easily make interesting new connections between chunks in the different fields, which can enhance your creativity even further. Of course it takes time to develop solid chunks of knowledge in different fields, so sometimes there's a tradeoff. Developing expertise in several fields means you can bring very new ideas from one field to the other, but it can also mean that your expertise in one field or the other isn't quite as deep as that of the person who specializes in only one discipline. On the other hand, if you develop expertise in only one discipline, you may know it very deeply but you may become more deeply entrenched in your familiar way of thinking and not be able to handle new ideas.**


Philosopher of science Thomas Kuhn discovered that most paradigm shifts in science are brought about either young people or people who were originally trained in a different discipline. They're not so easily trapped by einstellung, blocked thoughts due to their preceding training. And of course there's the old saying that science progresses one funeral at a time as people entrenched in the old ways of looking at things die off. Finally, don't make the mistake of thinking that learning only occurs in the kinds of subjects you acquire from teachers or books. When you teach a child how to deal effectively with a bully, or you fix a leaky faucet, or you quickly pack a small suitcase for a business trip to Hong Kong, all of these illustrate the outcomes of important aspects of learning. Physicist Richard Feynman was inspired in his Nobel Prize-winning work by watching someone throw a dinner plate into the air in a cafeteria. Mike Rowe of the television shows Dirty Jobs and Somebody's Gotta Do It show important and exciting learning can be in a variety of different, non-academic disciplines.


##Summary

In this video, I'm going to synthesize some of the main ideas of this week's videos. In other words, we'll chunk our week on chunking. Here we go:

- Chunks are pieces of information, neuro scientifically speaking, that are bound together through use and often through meaning. You can think of a chunk as a scintillating network of neurons that compactly synthesizes key ideas or actions.

- Chunks can get bigger and more complex. But at the same time, they're a single easy to access item that you can fit like a ribbon into the slot on your working memory.

- Chunks are best built with focused, undivided attention, understanding of the basic idea, and practice to help deepen your patterns and to help you gain big picture context.

- Simple recall, trying to remember the key points without looking at the page, is one of the best ways to help the chunking process along. It seems to help build neural hooks. They help you better understand the material. Also try recalling material in places that are different from where you originally learned the material, so it becomes more deeply ingrained and accessible, regardless of what room you're in. This can be very helpful for tests.

- Transfer is the idea that a chunk you've mastered in one area can often help you much more easily learn chunks of information in different areas that can share surprising commonalities.

- Interleave your learning by practicing your choice of different concepts, approach, and techniques all in one session. Chunks are very important, but they don't necessarily build flexibility, which is also important in becoming an expert with the material you're learning.

- Illusions of competence in learning – learn to recognize when you're fooling yourself about whether you're actually learning the material. Test yourself frequently. Using little mini-tests to see whether you're actually learning the material, or whether you've been fooling yourself, thinking you're learning when you're actually not. Recall is actually a form of mini-testing. Try to avoid depending too much on highlighting, which can fool you into thinking that the material is going into your brain when it actually isn't.

- Mistakes are a good thing to make when you're learning. They allow you to catch illusions of competence. Avoid practicing only the easy stuff, which can bring the illusion that you've mastered the material.

- Deliberately practice what you find more difficult to gain full mastery of the material.

- Einstellung is when your initial thought, an idea you've already had in mind, or a neural pattern you've already developed well and strengthened, prevents a better idea or solution from being found. Or keeps you from being flexible enough to accept new, better, or more appropriate solutions. The Law of Serendipity is helpful – Lady Luck favors the one who tries. Just pick one tiny thing out to learn, then another. Just keep trying and you'll be pleasantly surprised at the results.


> Deliberate practice is continuing to focus of the material you find hardest and is important to productive studying.
