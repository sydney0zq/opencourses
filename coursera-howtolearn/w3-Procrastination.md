## Introduction to Procrastination（拖延） and Memory

This week we're going to be talking about two seemingly（表面上的） different ideas. Procrastination and memory. But the two topics are intimately（密切的） related. Why? Because building solid chunks of long term memory, chunks that are easily accessible by your short term memory, takes time. It's not the kind of thing you want to be putting off until the last minute. You already have one good tool for procrastination. The pomodoro. That powerful 25 minute concentrated period of energized focus. This week we're going tofill you in with more information about how procrastination happens and simple ways to tackle it. And this is key. Ways that don't take much will power, then we'll move on to talking about some of the best ways to access your brain's most powerful long-term memory systems.


##Tackling Procrastination: It’s easier and more valuable than you think

Arsenic（砷） is incredibly toxic（有毒的）. For centuries until modern methods of detection were discovered, murderers found it to be a very popular substance（物质）. So you can imagine the shock at the 48th meeting of the German Association of Arts and Sciences in 1875 when two men sat in the front of the audience and downed more than double a deadly dose（剂量） of arsenic. The next day the men were back at the conference smiling and healthy. How is it possible to take something so bad for you and stay alive, and even look healthy, despite the damage being done at a microscopic level to your body? The answer has an uncanny（怪异的） relationship to procrastination that's what we're going to be talking about in the next few videos. 


You've already learned one handy（好用的） tool to help you with procrastination, the Pomodoro, that 25 minute period of uninterrupted focus followed by a bit of relaxation. This week we're going to learn more. Understanding a little about the cognitive（认知的） psychology of procrastination, just like understanding the chemistry of poison, can help us develop healthy preventatives（预防）. In these videos, I'm going to teach you the lazy person's approach to tackling procrastination. This means you'll be learning about your inner zombies – the routine, habitual（通常的） responses your brain falls into as a result of specific cues. These zombie responses are often focused on making the here and now better. As you'll see you can trick some of these zombies into helping you fend off（挡开） procrastination when you need to.

Not all procrastination is bad. Even if you're pretty good already in handling procrastination you'll learn some helpful insights here that can allow you to better prioritize（优先考虑） your learning. **The reason that learning to avoid procrastination is so important is that good learning is a bit by bit activity. You want to avoid cramming（塞满） which doesn't build solid neural structures. By putting the same amount of time into your learning but spacing that learning out by starting earlier you'll learn better.** First things first（先说重要的）.


**Unlike procrastination which is easy to fall into, willpower（意志力） is hard to come by. It uses a lot of neural resources. You shouldn't waste willpower on fending off procrastination except when absolutely necessary. Best of all as you'll see you don't need to.** If you'll remember we procrastinate about things that make us a little bit uncomfortable. You think about something you don't particularly like and the pain centers of your brain light up so you shift and narrow your focus of attention to something more enjoyable. This causes you to feel better. **At least temporarily but sadly the long term effects of habitual avoidance can be nasty. When you put off（延期） your studies it can become even more painful to think about studying it.** You can choke on tests because you haven't laid the firm neural foundations you need to feel comfortable with the material.


**Procrastination can be a single monumentally（非常的） important keystone（主旨） bad habit, a habit in other words that influences many important areas of your life. If you improve your abilities in this area many other positive changes will gradually begin to unfold. Procrastination shares features with addiction. It offers temporary excitement and relief from sometimes boring reality. It's easy to fool yourself for example into thinking that the best use of any given moment is. Surfing the web for information instead of actually reading the textbook or doing the assigned problems.** You start to tell yourself stories. For example you might tell yourself that organic（有机的） chemistry requires special reasoning, your weakness, so of course you're doing very poorly at it. You devise（设计） irrational（不合理的） excuses that sound superficially reasonable like if I study too far ahead of the test I'll forget the material. If you're troubled by procrastination you may even start telling yourself that procrastination is an innate（先天的） unchangeable characteristic. After all if procrastination were easily fixable wouldn't you have fixed it by now?


**The higher you go in your studies however the more important it is to take control of procrastination. Habits that worked in earlier years can turn around and bite you. What I'll show you in these next few videos is how you can become the master of your habit. You should be making the decisions, not your well-meaning（善意） but unthinking zombies, your habits. As you'll see, the strategies for dealing with procrastination are simple. It's just that sometimes they aren't intuitively obvious.**


So let's return to that story that began this video. The arsenic eaters started with tiny doses of arsenic. In tiny doses, arsenic doesn't seem harmful. You can even build up an immunity（免疫力） to its effects. This can allow you to take larger doses and look healthy, even as the poison is slowly increasing your risk of cancer and ravaging（毁坏） your organs. In a similar way procrastinators put off just that one little thing. They do it again and again gradually growing used to it. They can even look healthy but the long term effects? Not so good.


##Zombies Everywhere

Just imagine backing out of a driveway for the first time ever in your life. For some of you, that might seem like a pretty exciting proposition. The first time you might do this you would be in hyper（高度紧张的） alert. The deluge（洪水） of information coming at you would make the job seem almost impossibly difficult. But, once you've chunked how to back up down your driveway, all you have to do is think, let's go. And, off you go. **Your brain goes into this sort of zombie mode, where it is only semi aware of a few key factors, instead of being overwhelmed by all the data. It's the same idea with riding a bicycle. At first, it's really hard, later it's easy.**


**Neuro-scientifically speaking, chunking is related to habit. Habit is an energy saver for us. It allows us to free our mind for other types of activities. You go into this habitual zombie mode far more often than you might think. That's the point of habit, you don't have to think in a focused manner about what you’re doing while you're performing the habit. It saves energy. Habits can be good and bad. They can be brief, like absently（心不在焉的） brushing back your hair. Or they can be long, for example when you take a walk, or watch television for a few hours after you get home from work.

**You can think of habits as having four parts. The first is the cue（提示）. This is the trigger that launches you into zombie mode.** The cue may be something as simple as seeing the first item in your to do list. Time to start next week's homework. Or seeing a text message from a friend. Time to stop work. A cue by itself is, neither helpful nor harmful; it's the routine. **What we do in reaction to that cue, that's what matters.**


**Number two – the routine. This is your zombie mode. The routine habitual response your brain is used to falling into when it receives the cue. Zombie responses can be useful, harmless, or sometimes harmful.**


**Number three, the reward. Every habit develops and continues because it rewards us. It gives us an immediate little feeling of pleasure. Procrastination's an easy habit to develop because the reward, moving your mind's focus to something more pleasant, happens so quickly and easily. But good habits can also be rewarded. Finding ways to reward good study habits is important for escaping procrastination.**


**Number four – the belief. Habits have power because of your belief（信赖） in them. For example, you might feel you'll never be able to change your habits of putting off your studies until late in the day. To change a habit, you'll need to change your underlying belief.


##Surf’s Up: Process versus Product

**One of the best ways of being effective in your learning is to use mental tools and tricks to inspire and motivate yourself. First, when it comes to learning in general, you should realize that it's perfectly normal to start with a few negative feelings about beginning a learning session. Even when it's a subject you ordinary like, it's how you handle those feelings that matters.** Researchers have found that non-procrastinators put their negative thinking aside saying things to themselves like: quit wasting time and just get on with it, once you get going, you'll feel better about it. If you find yourself avoiding certain tasks because they make you feel uncomfortable, you should know there's another helpful way to re-frame things. And that's to learn to focus on process not product.

![](http://okye062gb.bkt.clouddn.com/2017-02-09-042557.jpg)

**Process means, the flow of time and the habits and actions associated with that flow of time. As in, I'm going to spend 20 minutes working. Product is an outcome, for example, a homework assignment that you need to finish. To prevent procrastination you want to avoid concentrating on product. Instead, your attention should be on building processes. Processes relate to simple habits, habits that coincidentally allow you to do the unpleasant tasks that need to be done.** For example, let’s say you don't like doing homework in a particular class. So you put off working on the homework. It's only five questions you think. How hard could that be? Deep down, you realize that answering these five questions could be a very lengthy（长时间的） job. It's easier to live in a fantasy world where the five questions, or the ten page report or whatever, can be done at the last minute. **Your challenge is to avoid focusing on the product, the answers to the questions. The product is what triggers the pain that causes you to procrastinate. Instead, you need to focus on the process or processes – the small chunks of time you need over days or even weeks to answer the questions or prepare for tests. Who cares whether you finish the homework or grasp the key concepts in any one session. The whole point instead, is that you calmly put forth your best effort for a short period.**

![](http://okye062gb.bkt.clouddn.com/2017-02-09-042648.jpg)

**Now process. Notice how in this picture physicist and surfer Garret Lacy is focused on the moment. Not on the accomplishment of having surfed that wave. For you, one of the easiest ways to focus on process is to focus on doing a Pomodoro, a 25 minute timed work session, not on completing a task. The essential idea here is that the zombie habitual part of your brain likes processes because it can march mindlessly along. It's far easier to enlist the friendly zombie habit to help with a process, than to help with a product. By focusing on process rather than product, you allow yourself to back away from judging yourself, am I getting closer to finishing? And instead you allow yourself to relax into the flow of the work.** The key is when a distraction（分心） arises, which it inevitably（必然的） will, you want to train yourself to just let it flow by（锻炼自己顺其自然）. Of course, setting yourself up so that distractions are minimal is also a very good idea. Many students find that either a quiet space or noise canceling headphones if you can afford them, can be helpful when they're really trying to concentrate.


## Harnessing（治理） Your Zombies to Help You

In this video, we're going to get into the specifics of harnessing your zombie powers of habit to help youavoid procrastination while minimizing your use of willpower. You don't want to do a full scale change of old habits. You just want to override parts of them and develop a few new ones. The trick to overriding a habit is to look to change your reaction to a cue. The only place you need to apply willpower is to change your reaction to the cue. To understand that, it helps to go back through the fourcomponents of habit and re-analyze them from the perspective of procrastination.

![](http://okye062gb.bkt.clouddn.com/2017-02-09-050059.jpg)

The first one is the cue. Recognize what launches you into your zombie procrastination mode. Cues usually fall into one of the four following categories:

1. Location
2. Time
3. How you feel, and
4. Reactions either to other people or to something that just happened.


Do you look something up on the web and then find yourself web surfing? Does a text message disturb your studying taking you 10 minutes to get back into the flow of things even when you try to keep yourself on task? The issue with procrastination is that because it's an automatic habit, you're often unaware that you've begun to procrastinate. You can prevent the most damaging cues by shutting off your cell phone or keeping yourself away from the internet and other distractions for brief periods of time, as when you're doing a pomodoro.


**Number two, the routine. Let's say then instead of doing your studies you often divert（转向） your attention to something less painful. Your brain wants to automatically go into this routine when you've gotten your cue. So this is the reaction clue where you must actively focus on re-wiring your old habit. The key tore-wiring is to have a plan. Developing a new ritual（仪式） can be helpful. Some students make it a habit to leave their phone in their car when they head in for class which removes a potent（迅速见效的） distraction（分心）. Many students discovered the value of settling into a quiet spot in the library or closer to home, the productive effects of simply sitting in a favorite chair at the proper time with all Internet access disconnected. Your plan may not work perfectly at first, but just keep at it. Adjust the plan if necessary,and savor（尽情享受） those victories when your plan works. Don't try to change everything at once. The Pomodoro technique can be especially helpful in shifting your reaction to the cues.**


**Number three is the reward. This can sometimes require a little bit of investigation. Why are you procrastinating? Can you substitute an emotional pay off, maybe a feeling of pride for accomplishing something, even if it's small, a sense of satisfaction? Can you win a small internal bet or a contest about something you've turned into a personal game or allow yourself to indulge in a latte（拿铁） or read a favorite web site, provide yourself, maybe, with an evening of mindless television or web surfing without guilt, and will you give yourself a bigger reward for a bigger achievement? Maybe movie tickets or a sweateror an utterly（完全的） frivolous（不必要的） purchase. Remember that habits are powerful because they create neuro logical cravings（渴望）. It helps to add a new reward if you want to overcome your previous cravings. Only once your brain starts expecting that reward will the important rewiring take place that will allow you to create new habits. Many people find that setting a reward at a specific time, for example, breaking for lunch with a friend at the deli at noon or stopping the main task at 5 p.m., gives a solid, mini deadline that can help spur work. Don't feel bad if you find you have trouble getting into a flow state at first. I sometimes find it takes a few days of drudgery（苦活）, through a few cycles of the Pomodoro technique before flow begins to unfold. And I find myself starting to enjoy work on a new topic. Also remember that the better you get at something, the more enjoyable it can become.**


**Number four is the belief. The most important part of changing your procrastination habit is the belief that you can do it. You may find that when the going gets stressful. You long to fall back into old, more comfortable habits. Belief that your new system works is what can get you through. Part of what can underpin is to develop a new community. Hang out with classmates, or virtually hang out with MOOC-mates, who may have that can-do philosophy that you too want to develop. Developing and encouraging culture with like-minded friends can help us remember the values that in moments of weakness we tend to forget.**



##Juggling（玩耍） Life and Learning

![](http://okye062gb.bkt.clouddn.com/2017-02-09-051006.jpg)

**Learning for most people involves a complex balancing of many different tasks. A good way for you to keep perspective about what you're trying to learn and accomplish, is to once a week write a brief weekly list of key tasks in a planner journal. Then each day on another page of your planner journal, write a list of the tasks that you can reasonably work on or accomplish. Try to write this daily task list the evening before. Why the evening before? Research has shown that this helps your subconscious to grapple with the tasks on the list so you can figure out how to accomplish them. Writing the list before you go to sleep, enlists your zombies, to help you accomplish the items on the list the next day. If you don't write your tasks down on a list, they lurk（潜伏） at the edge of the four or so slots of your working memory, taking up valuable mental real estate（财产）. But once you make a task list, it frees working memory for problem solving. So let's look at one of my daily task lists.**

![](http://okye062gb.bkt.clouddn.com/2017-02-09-051118.jpg)

As you can see here, there are only six items. Some are process oriented. For example, I have a paper due to a journal in several months. So, I spend a little focus time on most days working towards completing it. A few items are product oriented. But that is only because they are doable（可行的） within a limited period of time. Note my reminders. I wanted to keep my focus on each item when I'm working on it. And I want to have fun. I did catch myself getting side tracked, because I forgot to shut down my email. To get myself back into gear, I set a 22 minute Pomodoro challenge, using a timer on my computer desktop. Why 22 minutes? Well, why not? I don't have to do the same thing each time. And notice that by moving to Pomodoro mode, I've switched to a process orientation. None of the items on my list is too big, because I've got other things going on in my day. Meetings to go to, a lecture to give. Sometimes I sprinkle a few tasks that involve physical motion on my list, even if it's just cleaning something. Which, I'll admit, isn't ordinarily one of my favorite things to do. Somehow because I'm using them as diffuse mode breaks, I often look forward to them.


**Mixing other tasks up with your learning seems to make everything more enjoyable and keeps you from prolonged and unhealthy bouts of sitting. Over time, as I've gained more experience, I've gotten much better at gauging（标准宽度） how long it takes to do any given task. You'll find yourself improving quickly as you become more realistic about what you can reasonably do in any given time. Make notes in your planner journal about what works and what doesn't. Notice my goal finish time for the day, 5 p.m. doesn't seem quite right, does it? But it is right, and it's one of the most important components of your daily planner journal. Planning your quitting time is as important as planning your working time.** Generally, I aim to quit at 5 p.m., although when I'm learning something new, it can sometimes be a pleasure to look at it again after I've taken an evening break, just before I go to sleep, and occasionally, there's a major project that I'm wrapping up, like say, this MOOC that has me running into a bit of overtime. You might think, you know, but you're a professor who's shall we say, past your youthful study days. Of course an early quitting time is fine for you. However, one of my most admired study experts, Cal Newport, used the 5 p.m., quitting time through most of his student career. He ended up getting his PhD from MIT. In other words, this method, implausible（不合情理的） though it may seem for some, can work for undergraduate and graduate students in rigorous academic programs.

Time after time, those who are committed to maintaining healthy leisure time along with their hard work, outperform those who doggedly（顽强的） pursue an endless treadmill. Of course, your life may not lend itself to such a schedule with breaks and leisure time. You may be running on fumes（冒烟） with two jobs and too many classes. **But however your life is going, try to squeeze a little break time in.** One more thing – as writing coach Daphne Graygrant recommends to her writing clients, eat your frogs first in the morning. **Try to work on a most important and most disliked task first. At least just one Pomodoro, as soon as you wake up. This is incredibly effective.** Do you need to sometimes make changes in your plans because of unforeseen events? Of course, but remember the law of serendipity; Lady Luck favors the one who tries. Planning well is part of trying. **Keep your eye on your learning goal, and try not to get too unsettled by occasional roadblocks.**



## Summing Up Procrastination

Learning well often involves bit by bit, day by day building of solid neural scaffolds. Rather like a weightlifter builds muscle with day to day exercise. This is why tackling procrastination is so incredibly important. You want to keep up with your learning and avoid last minute cramming. So with that, here's an overview of the key aspects of tackling procrastination.

-   Keep a planner journal so you can easily track when you reach your goals and observe whatdoes and doesn't work.

-   Commit yourself to certain routines and tasks each day.

-   Write your planned tasks out the night before so your brain has time to dwell on your goals and help ensure success.

-   Arrange your work into a series of small challenges.

-   Always make sure you, and your zombies, get lots of rewards.

-   Take a few minutes to savor the feelings of happiness and triumph, which also gives your brain a chance to temporarily change modes.

-   Deliberately delay rewards until you've finished a task.

-   Watch for procrastination cues. Try putting yourself in new surroundings with few procrastination cues, such as the quiet section of a library.

-   Gain trust in your new system. You want to work hard during times of focused concentration and also to trust your system enough so that when it comes time to relax, you actually relax without feelings of guilt or worry.

-   Have back up plans for when you still procrastinate. No one’s perfect after all.

  -Eat your frogs first every day. Happy experimenting.


> “Eat a live frog first thing in the morning and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day.”	--Mark Twain
