## The Value of Team Work

This is a CT scan. If you look carefully, the shadowed region right here reveals the damage caused by right hemisphere ischemic stroke（右脑缺血性中风引起的损伤）. Such a stroke can cause an unusual condition known as broad-perspective perceptual disorder of the right hemisphere. People with this disorder can still function, but only partially. They can retain their intelligence, even a formidable way for solving complex math problems, if that was a skill they'd had before. But an interesting anomaly（反常）, however, is if they make a mistake in their calculations, concluding something nonsensical, such as that a hot dog stand had a profit and loss statement with aloss of nearly a billion dollars. It doesn't bother them. **There's no big picture; that says the answer does not make sense.**


Although we need to be careful about faulty and superficial left brain, right brain assumptions. We also don't want to throw the baby out with the bath water, and ignore worthwhile research that gives intriguing hints about differences between the two hemispheres of the brain. **There's a great deal of evidence from research that the right hemisphere helps us step back and put ourwork into big picture perspective.** People with damage to the right hemisphere are often unable to gain ah-ha, insights. The right hemisphere, as it turns out, is vitally important in getting into the right track and doing reality checks. People with strokes can remind us of the dangers of not using our full cognitive abilities, which involve many areas of our brain.

**Even subtle（微妙的） avoidance（回避） of some of our capabilities can have a surprisingly negative impact onour work. In some sense, when you whiz through a homework or test question and don't go back to check your work, you're acting a little like a person who's refusing to use parts of your brain. You're not stopping to take a mental breath. And then revisit what you've done with the bigger picture in mind to see whether it makes sense.** As leading neuroscientist Vilayanur S.Ramachandran has noted, the right hemisphere serves as a sort of devil's advocate to questionthe status quo and look for global inconsistencies. While the left hemisphere instead tries tocling tenaciously to the way things were. This echos the pioneering work of psychologistMichael Gazzaniga who posited that the left hemisphere interprets the world for us and will goto great lengths to keep those interpretations unchanging.


When you work in the focus mode, it's easy to make minor mistakes in your assumptions orcalculations. If you go off track early on, it doesn't matter if the rest of your work is correct. Your answer is still wrong. Sometimes, it's even laughably wrong. The equivalent of calculating a circumference of the earth that's only two and a half feet around. But these non-sensical results just don't matter to you because the more left centered focus mode has associated with it a desire to cling to what you've done. That's the problem with the focus, sometimes a bit left hemisphere leaning mode of analysis. **It provides for an analytical and upbeat approach, but abundant research evidence suggests there's a potential for rigidity, dogmatism, and egocentricity. When you're absolutely certain that what you've done on a homework or test is fine, thank you very much, be aware that this feeling may be based on overly confident perspectives arising in part from the left hemisphere.** When you step back and recheck, you'reallowing for more interaction between the hemispheres, taking advantage of the special perspectives and abilities of each. **Nobel Prize winning physicist Richard Feynman perhaps said it best when he pointed out, the first principle is that you must not fool yourself. And you are the easiest person to fool.**


One of the best ways to catch your blind spots and errors is to brainstorm and work with others who are also smartly focused on the topic. It's sometimes just not enough to use more of your own neural horsepower. Both modes and hemispheres to analyze your work. After all, everyone has blind spots. You're naively upbeat focused mode can still skip right over errors, especially if you're the one who committed the original errors. Worse yet, sometimes you can blindly believe you've got everything nailed down intellectually, but you haven't. This is the kind of thing that can leave you in shock when you discover you've flunked the test you thought you aced. By making it a point to do some of your studying with friends, you can more easily catch where your thinking has gone a stray. Friends and teammates can serve as sort of ever questioning larger scale diffuse mode outside your brain that can catch what you missed, or what you just can't see. And of course, explaining to friends helps build your own understanding.


The importance of working with others doesn't just relate to learning. It's also important in career building. A single small tip from a teammate to take a course from the outstanding Professor Passionate, or to check out a new job opening, can make an extraordinary difference in how your life unfolds. A word of warning, however; study groups can be powerfully effective for learning, but if study sessions turn into socializing occasions, all bets are off. Keep small talk（闲聊） to a minimum, get your group on track. And finish your work. If you find that your group meetings start five to 15 minutes late, members haven't read the material, and the conversation consistently veers off topic, you're best off to find another group.


##A Test Checklist

We've mentioned it earlier, but it's worth repeating. Testing is itself an extraordinarily powerful learning experience. This means that the effort you put into test-taking, including the preliminary mini test of your recall and your ability to problem solve during your preparation is of fundamental importance. **If you compare how much you learn by spending one hour studying, versus one hour taking a test on that same material, you'll retain and learn far more as a result of the hour you spent taking a test. Testing, it seems, has a wonderful way of concentrating the mind.** Virtually everything we've talked about in this course has been designed to help make the testing process seem straightforward and natural, simply an extension of the normal procedures you use to learn the material.

##Hard Start Jump to Easy

Now that you've gotten some insight into how your brain works, we can give you some final useful tricks that can empower your test taking. The classic way students are taught to approach tests is to tackle the easiest problems first. This is based on the idea that by the time you finish the relatively simple problems, you'll be confident in handling the more difficult. This approach works for some people, mostly because, well, anything works for some people. Unfortunately, however, for many people it's counterproductive（适得其反）. Tough problems often need lots of time, meaning you'd want to start on them first thing on the test. Difficult problems can also scream for the creative powers of the diffuse mode. But to access the diffuse mode, you need to not be focusing on what you so badly want to solve. What to do? Easy problems first, or hard?


The answer is to start with the hard problems but quickly jump to the easy ones. Here's what I mean. When the test is first handed out to you, first take a quick look to get a sense of what it involves. You should do this in any case. Then, when you start working the problems, start first with what appears to be the hardest problem. But steel yourself to pull away within the first minute or two, if you get stuck or you get a sense that you might not be on the right track. This does something exceptionally helpful. Starting hard loads the first most difficult problem in mind and then switches attention away from it. Both these activities are what allow the diffuse mode to begin its work. If your initial work on the first hard problem has unsettled you, turn next to an easy problem, and complete or do as much as you can. Then move to another difficult looking problem and try to make a bit of progress. Again, change to something easier as soon as you feel yourself getting bogged down or stuck.


When you return to the more difficult problems, you'll often be pleased that the next step or steps in the problem will seem to be more obvious to you. You may not be able to get all the way to the end immediately, but at least you can get further before you switch to something else of which you can make progress. In some sense, with this approach to test taking, you're being a little like an efficient chef. While you're waiting for a steak to fry, you can swiftly slice the tomato garnish and turn to season the soup and then stir the sizzling onions. The hard start jump to easy technique may make more efficient use of your brain by allowing different parts of the brain to work simultaneously on different thoughts.


Using the hard start jump to easy technique on tests guarantees that you will have at least a little work done on every problem. It's also a valuable technique for helping you avoid Einstellung, getting stuck on the wrong approach - because you have a chance to look at the problem from differing perspectives. All of this is particularly important if your instructor gives you partial credit. The only trick with this approach is that you must have the self-discipline to pull yourself off a problem once you find yourself stuck for a minute or two. For most students it's easy, for others it takes discipline and willpower. This may be why test takers sometimes find that the solution pops to mind right as they walk out the door; when they give up, their attention switched, allowing the diffuse mode the tiny bit of traction it needed to go to work and return the solution. Too late of course.


Sometimes, people are concerned that starting a problem and then pulling away from it might cause confusion on an examination. This doesn't seem to be a problem for most people. After all, chefs learn to bring various facets of a dinner together. But if you still have worries about whether this strategy might work for you, try it first on homework problems. Also keep in mind that if you haven't prepared well for a test, then all bets are off. Just take what simple points you can.


##Final Helpful Hints for Tests

![](http://okye062gb.bkt.clouddn.com/2017-02-10-023553.jpg)

If you're a stressed out test taker, keep in mind that the body puts out chemicals such as cortisol when it's under stress. This can cause sweaty palms, a racing heart, a knot on the pit of your stomach. But interestingly, research finds, it's how you interpret these symptoms. The story you tell yourself about why you're stressed makes all the difference. If you shift your thinking from, this test has made me afraid, to this test has got me excited to do my best. It can really improve your performance.


Another good tip for panicky test takers is to momentarily turn your attention to your breathing. Relax your stomach, place your hand on it, and slowly draw a deep breath. Your hand should move out, even as your whole chest is expanding outward like a barrel. By doing this type of deep breathing, you're counteracting the fight or flight response that fuels anxiety. This calms you down. But don't just start this breathing on the day of the test. If you practice this breathing technique in the weeks before, just a minute or two here or there is all it takes. You'll slide more easily into the breathing pattern during the test. Remember, practice makes permanent. It's especially helpful deliberately moving to a deep breathing pattern in those final anxious moments before a test is handed out.


I've gotten great tips on test taking from top professors from around the world. And here are some of the best. Susan Sajna-Hebert, a professor of psychology at Lakehead University, advises her students to cover up the answers to multiple choice questions and to try to recall the information. So they can answer the question on their own first. If her students might complain that the practice test was way easier than the real one, she asks, what makes the two situations different? When you took the practice test, were you at home relaxing with toons on? Taking it with a fellow student? No time limit? Did you have the answer key and class materials at hand? These circumstances are not exactly like a crowded classroom with a clock ticking away and no way to access the answers.


Tracy Magrann, a professor of biological sciences at Saddleback College, tells her students to face your fears. Often, your worst fear is not to get the grade you need for your chosen career. How can you handle this? Simple. Have a Plan B for the alternative career. Once you have a plan for the worst possible contingency, you'll be surprised that the fear will begin to subside. Professor Magrann notes, study hard up until the day of the test and then let it go. Tell yourself, oh well, let me just see how many questions I can get right. I can always pursue my other career choice. That helps release stress, so you can actually do better and get closer to your first career choice. And Bob Bradshaw, a professor of math at Ohlone College, tells his students about good worry and bad worry. Good worry helps provide motivation and focus, while bad worry simply wastes energy.


Here are a few final thoughts. The day before a test, or tests, have a quick, final look over the materials to brush up on them. You'll need both your focus mode and diffuse mode muscles, so
to speak, the next day. So you don't want to push your brain too hard. You wouldn't run a ten mile race the day before running a marathon. Don't feel guilty if you can't seem to get yourself to work too hard the day before a big examination. If you prepared properly, this seems to be a natural reaction, almost as if you're subconsciously pulling back to conserve mental energy. While taking a test, you should also remember how your mind can trick you into thinking that what you've done is correct, even if it isn't. This means whenever possible, you should blink, shift your attention, and then double check your answers using a, a big picture prospective asking yourself, does this really makes sense.


There's often more than one way to answer a question and checking your answers from different perspectives provides a golden opportunity for verifying what you've done. If there's no other way to check, except to step back through your logic, keep in mind that simple issues have tripped up even the most advanced students. Just do your best. In science classes, having your units of measurement match on each side of the equation can provide an important clue about whether what you've done is correct. The order in which you work tests is also important. Students generally work tests from front to back. When you're checking your work if you start more towards the back and work towards the front, it sometimes seems to give your brain a fresher perspective that can allow you to more easily catch errors. Nothing's ever certain. Occasionally you can study hard and the test gods simply don't cooperate, but if you prepare well by practicing and building a strong mental library, and you approach test taking wisely, you'll find that luck will increasingly be on your side.


##Wrap Up to the Course by Terrence Sejnowski and Barbara Oakley

Dr. Sejnowski: Welcome to the last video of Learning How to Learn. If you're still listening to us, then you've come all the way through the course. And may remember at the beginning, I said that brains do not come with an instruction manual. So we have to write one ourselves. And that was one of our goals. In this final video, we want to tell you how much we've enjoyed teaching and learning. We've learned from you as we hoped you've learned from us. The truth is you've always been in the driver's seat when it comes to your own learning. But now that you have a better feeling for what's under your neural hood, you can use this to help you learn new things all during your lifetime.


Dr. Oakley: What we're hoping is that as the days and months will pass you'll continue to bring to mind some of the key ideas you've learned in the course. Approaches such as switching your mode of thinking from focused to diffuse can help reduce your frustration and allow for more creative problem solving. Strengthening your chunking can give you a firmer grasp of the material. Even seemingly tiny changes in your daily approach to your work. Using the pomodoro technique, for example, can make a dramatic long-term difference in your learning and in your ultimate success.


Dr. Sejnowski: Learning is so vitally important to our future that most of us spend 12 to 16 of our earliest years of our lives in school, culminating in high school or college. But the focus in formal education is on the product of learning, not the process of learning. In this course, we've tried to give you a better sense of the learning process. Although this is our last video, we hope it's not our last chance to influence you. You have not truly learned something unless you can teach it to others. Teach those ideas to others and you will find that they will continue to resonate and deepen in your own mind.


Dr. Oakley: We hope you'll also have discovered how powerful these ideas can be at helping you broaden your interest, passion, and expertise. Many people believe that what they're initially, sort of, naturally good at is what they're supposed to be doing in life. But I myself am living proof that passions can broaden, change, and grow. The world is evolving and a broad tool kit that allows you to learn effectively in many different subject areas is one of the most powerful assets you can have.


Dr. Sejnowski: Best of luck in your life of learning. 


Dr. Oakley: Ditto that.
