##Installing Docker

Docker's main job is to manage a Linux server and start containers on it.

When you're running on a Mac or Windows, most people use a Linux Virtual Machine, running on their computer for this purpose. Docker Toolbox, which we'll be installing shortly, has some great tools for managing this process. If you happen to have an old version of Boot2Docker installed, you may need remove it first if you encounter problems.


```
Installation

- Docker needs a Linux server to manage
- Many people use a virtual machine on their laptop
- Docker Toolbox helps run this Linux virtual machine
- If you have Boot2Docker installed, you must remove it first
```

And now a brief overview of the installation process. We start with Your Computer. This is the thing you're physically typing on.

On that, Docker Toolbox will install a program called Docker that lets you manager Docker Virtual Machines and do everything else that Docker does.
