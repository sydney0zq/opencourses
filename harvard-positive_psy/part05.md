You will be spending quality time in small groups with them.

今天教授将开始讲授第五个前提, 这个 premise 也很重要。Happiness is important. But that does not mearn that it is important, the fact that it is important doesn't mean we ought to do it. Professor's argument here is that not only is it important, it also ought to be important. Happiness, whether we like it or not, whether it is consciously, subconsciously, whether it is explicit or implicit, for most people, it is the highest end. 教授又举证几百年前和现代人们说幸福的名人句子。

教授提出了一个问题。What about the moral dimension of happiness? There are so many other things happening, so many important things to do in the world. **Why should we have happiness as our highest end, as our chief concern, as that which determines the motion of our life?** In other words, what is good about wellbeing? What is good about positive emotions?

The first key issue is that it is good in and of itself, almost needs no justification. Positive emotions have an evolutionary reason, that they have a purpose beyond just making us feel good. For example, they help us think beyond what we are thinking right now, broaden our thinking; they help us build relationships; they help us build capacities.

Numerous benefits to just experiencing positive emotions. **What happens when we experience negative emotions is that our consciousness, our thinking narrows and constricts.** If our consciousness continues to narrow and constrict beyond the threat, or beyond the hardship, we will enter a downward spiral. A vicious cycle when we go into this narrow and constrict mode. For example, my girlfriend leaves me. And I narrow and constrict in terms of my thinking, all I thinking about is just that. And what will happen is as a result, I experience sadness, because that is what I am thinking about, which leads to further narrow and constrict. And that can potentially go on and on. And that is when it can become depression.

Positive emotions do the opposite. They broaden and build leads to positive emotions. Then positive emotions further broaden and build. So that is a virtuous cycle. A positive emotion can take us out of this downward spiral and create an upward spiral. A positive emotion can come in form of watching a humorous film. And again it does not always take a very long time. And the challenge is to combine "the permission to be human" to experience the emotion to go through the motion and yet not to enter the downward spiral where six months later after small incident. 

积极情绪也能激发创造力, 有很多 "抑郁创造者" 的说法, 即如果想有更高的创造力, 那么需要抑郁。其实并非如此, 狂躁抑郁病人一般更有创造力。但一般在狂躁阶段, 在抑郁阶段, 我们的思维在收窄, 我们失去创造力。实验证明, 积极的心情有助于我们在专业上的解决问题的能力, 他们思考更多的选择,  然后得出更好的问题解决办法。感觉更好的时候, 动力和精力更充沛。

随之教授讨论了只考虑自己是否开心是不是太自私, 首先快乐是 positive sum game, 我们的快乐不是从别人那里夺来, 并且快乐是传染的。教授也说明了自己快乐能带动旁边的人快乐, 自己感觉好对我们和他人都有益。比如一天多做五件好事, 可以试一试。帮助他人就是帮助自己, 这是一个循环, 不要把它看作自私。To appreciate has two meanings as we talked about: one is to say "thank you" for something and two is to grow. If we appreciate the good in our nature, in our inclinations, if we appreciate that part of our nature, it will appreciate and we will have more of it. If we look down at it and say, "It is a terrible thing that I just derive benefits from helping other people", then that part of our nature will depreciate over time.

教授还讲了一个关于甘地的有寓意的笑话。教育小孩吃糖的。

**People mostly do what you do, rather than what you say.** 教授都说了要放在 cheek 上, 虽然他自己放在了下巴上, 但是很多学生都把手放在了下巴上 (照着教授做)。由此引发了这句话。So you may want to spread happiness, through your word. But ultimately, the best way, the optimal way spreading happiness is to work your own happiness, because then you are leading by example. That applies to leadership. The most important thing about leadership is not what you say, it is what you do. The most important thing abou t parenting, it's not how much you tell your child"honesty is important"., but rather how honest you are.

至此, 五个基本前提已经讲完, 这构成了这门课的基础。未来的课程会拓展这些基础, 最重要的是如何讲这些原则应用于生活。

下一课开始, Belief as self-fulfilling prophecies.(信念即自我实现预言)

教授要将一个故事, 这个故事让他明白心理学对于幸福和快乐是多么的重要。Roger Bannister 事例, 此处不再赘述。教授的例子在说明信念很强大。Beliefs are self-fulfilling prophecies, very often they determined how we perform, how well or how poorly we perform. They often determine how good or not so good our relationships are. They are the NO.1 predictor of life success as well as wellbeing. 本节课和下节课讨论的是 "信念如何形成现实"。 How it works? What is the mechanism, the science behind the power of the mind?

Pygmalion 是古希腊语, 是个雕刻家。成年后他想找理想中的女人, 想结婚。他一直都找不到, 于是返回雅典。他告诉自己: 我不再寻找理想中的女人, 我要以她的形象雕刻一座雕像。他最后雕刻出来了, 他看到她的时候, 被激动之情和悲伤淹没。但他找不到她, 于是他开始哭泣。宙斯, 雅典娜, 特别是阿芙罗狄蒂, 俯视他, 深感同情, 于是把雕像复活。当然他们幸福的生活下去。什么鬼啊, 不太懂什么意思。[窈窕淑女] 是以这个为原型的剧。

教授又举了一个很经典的例子, 关于对老师说哪些学生比较有潜力, 之后再复查结果。发现那些被随机选中的有 "潜力" 的学生的成绩有明显进步, 比任何学生进步的都快, 并且在数学这样的客观学科也有进步, 比其他任何学生进步都大。并且那些被随机选中的 "潜力" 学生, 在一年间有很大的增加, 而且长期研究中保持增加。想起我小学好像也是这样:) 感谢我的小学老师。这让人不解, IQ 应该是不变的, 但是它却因为老师的信念而变化了。信念即自我实现预言。这就说明了每个学生都有潜力。这和教授之前讲的呼应, 对潜力灌溉, 撒播阳光, 种子就开始发芽生长。

我们知道无视一部分现实是多么容易, 就算他们就在我们眼前。

The power of the situation. 强大的积极的情景对我们至关重要。只是 "扮演" 某个角色, 他们就变成那个角色。

现在问题就是我们如何制造积极的环境。教授又介绍了几个实验, 基本都是我知道的。这也说明了情景对我们的重要性, 对我们潜意识影响很大。
