##Part 4 of Positive Psychology 1504

助教上来来了一段[All My Life]的音乐祝贺情人节, 听起来还不错。不过原唱不行, 感觉还没助教唱的好听。

这节课的内容承接上面的课程, 仍然是"where we are from, where we are going."。这是整个课程螺旋的基础。

Last time we talked about the Twin studies that illustrate that what Lykken and Tellegen said maybe changing out happiness level is as difficult as trying to change our height. And we talked about the error of the average and the mistake that these researchers are making, misunderstanding the nature of change. Because if someone changes, the question is no longer "is it possible to change", but rather "how is it possible to change".

And then we talked about the Cambridge study that shows that literally the Roll-Royce of interventions failed. 5 years with the leading scientists researchers, psychiatrists, psycholohists from Cambridge, Harvard and MIT, putting their minds and hearts for good intentions to bring about change, failed. Not only they have failed in bringing about positive change, they actually brought about negative change. Such as alcoholism rates went up for the intervention group, compared to the control group. The control group that joined no intervention actually were more luckily to advance in their workspace 20 or 30 years later. **So change is difficult, but it is possible. The challenge then is, for us, if our goal is to become practial idealists, is to understand what it is that brings about change and then do it.** 

Good will, idealism, good intentions are not good enough. We need to be grounded in research. **The tip of the stem is actually about democratizing excellence. Studying the best and applying it to the rest of us.**

教授阐述了一部分人可以改变的世界的思想, 如"Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, commited citizens can change the world."**教授认为所有改变从一个人或一小众人的思想开始, 然后不断扩大。**问题是"它如何扩大", 并且为什么我们难以理解, 我们能够作出改变这个事实, 并接受, 被同化以及据此生活。

**Change happens exponentially.**因为我们和他人的联系形成了一个指数函数。它也解释了"六度空间"理论, 指出我们都是关联和相互关联的(We are all connected and interconnected)。教授又通过一大坨解释说明了这个观念。

教授开始举例说明指数理论的本质, 比如A与B做交易, 那么假如A给B每天3000美元, 持续30天; B给A第一天1分, 第二天2分, 依次持续30天。那么最后B给A的要远远大于A给B的3万美元。**我们低估了改变的力量, 是因为我们低估(underestimate)了指数函数的增长。**我们活着的每分钟都在影响世界和他人, 问题是我们选择哪个方向。教授你把我说服了。

教授开始讲第三个前提, 内在因素和外在因素。很多研究表明, 基于外在因素改变快乐很难。有人质疑调查问卷的客观性, 但是过去几年心理学家使用了大脑扫描等技术, 发现两者有很大的相关性。人们对于自己的幸福的评估, 即快乐的主观水平, 两者有很大的关联。这个多年来进行的研究提供了可信度, 在拥有技术进行更全面的研究之前。即这两者同样有意义有价值。(Both are meaningful as well as valuable.)

教授讲述了一个非常经典的关于快乐水平的研究, 指出在经历一些事情, 我们可能当时以为会快乐很久或者难过很久, 不过过了三个月过了六个月, 他们的幸福都恢复到之前的幸福水平。如果他们之前是不快乐的, 那么不论是否得到了终身教授职位, 那么过一段时间他们还是不快乐。这在以前的心理学中有讲。且经过严肃且认真的研究, 财富对幸福水平的影响很小。当然这不是说流浪汉每月有1000美元的收入, 这当然让他很快乐。But beyond the basic needs, once our basic needs are met and that means food, shelter, basic education. Income makes very little difference. No change across generations.

全球范围内, 幸福水平几乎是静止的, 焦虑水平和抑郁水平有明显的加深, 收入水平的影响很小。总的来说, 外部环境的影响很小。(External circumstances make very little difference.)同样的, place of residents makes very little difference. Initially when we go to a warm place, we feel the relief and there is this spiky level of wellbeing. But very quickly we go back to our base level, exactly where we were before. 

Once thing that does matter to our base level of wellbeing which is external circumstance is democracy versus oppression. People living in democracies are generally significantly happier than people living in dictatorships.

//希望小灯笼仔细读下面这段话, 很有意义。

由上面的论述得到了好消息和坏消息。坏消息是消极的, 我们不论做什么事情都无关紧要, 那么我为什么还要努力争取好工作。答案是它不会改变我们的幸福水平, 但这不意味这我们不能提升自己的幸福水平。The problem is not lower these high expectations, that does not matter. **The problem is right versus wrong expectations. Not lower high expectations, that won't make a difference to our levels of wellbeing. What will make a difference to our levels of wellbeing is if we have right vs. wrong expectations.** It is wrong expectation to expect that getting into a certain place, getting a raise, finding our dream partner, is responsible for our happiness. That in and of itself will not make us happier. **The right expectation is to believe in change from within. In fact, our readiness and potential to experience happiness is mostly depended on our state of mind, not on our status, or the states of our bank account.** It is about changing our perception--state of mind. It is about changing our interpretation of the world, of what is happening to us, of our achievements, of our failures. It is about what we choose to perceive, what we choose to focus on. It is about transformation, as opposed to the external information or the external success.

教授开始讲第四个前提, 这堂课最重要的一个前提, 我们能够理解人类智力发展历史, 仅仅因为这个观点: 应不应该接受人类本性? 我们能否完善它? 它能否被改变? Thomas Sowell认为, 他把人分成两个阵营, those who hold constrained vision, **the limited vision, and those who hold the unconstrained, the unlimited vision of human nature.** People who hold constrained vision of human nature believe that human nature cannot be changed, it is immutable--we have certain instincts, we have certain inclinations. The flaws that are out there are inevitable, they cannot be changed. We need to accept them for what they are. | And people who have the constrained vision think that our instincts, our inclinations, our basic nature is immutable, accepted. But then what they do, rather than resign, they channel it by building certain political institutions that would channel the flawed, imperfect human nature toward the good.

我们到底有没有认清现实, 对人类本性执不同的观点, 最终将影响我们的心理, 这是非常有意义和重要的。本课的观点是我们的本性不会很快改变, 在有生之年是不可能的。我们应该首先理解它, 之后好好利用它。这种观念对快乐, 幸福, 长久的成功非常重要。当论及我们的心理的时候, 人性受约束观点很重要。

在当今的文化中, 我们不准自己为人, 也没有体会痛苦情绪的自由, 我们为这种无能付出高昂代价, 为拒绝接受本性受约束, 生而有之的事实, 付出高昂代价。婴儿时期, 我们的情绪起起落落十分正常, 非常自然。后来我们停止准许自己为人的时候, 当表象变得很重要时, 当我们们开始发觉其他人在看我们时, 时刻评价我们的时候, 人们远没有我们以为的那么注意我们的时候XXXX听的不太懂。教授开始举例子, 关于准许自己为人的例子, 教授演示了一个婴儿情绪的自然流露。教授紧接着说, 不是要像这个孩子一样, 但是生活要有一个地方, 在那里我们准许自己为人, 那应该就是饭否了吧。可以是和挚友在一起的时候, 我们关心的人, 最重要的是面对自己的时候, 写日记的时候, 这时候我们准许自己为人。这不就是饭否嘛。。如果我们不这样做, 我们将付出代价。(We pay a price.) **We need a space of unconditional acceptance.**

教授生小孩的之后, 医生对他说了一段让他记忆很深的话:"Over the next few months, you are going to be experiencing every single kind of emotion to the extreme and that's fine. It is natural, and we all go through it."这是抚养孩子的最好建议。教授也举了例子: 一个月后, 教授有时候对他的儿子产生了妒忌, 因为这是妻子和他在一起后第一次有人夹在中间, 另一个人比教授获得更多的关注。但是在五分钟之后, 教授又对自己的孩子产生强烈的爱意, 一种他从未感受过的情绪。教授说这种情绪的转换是为人的一部分。他体会嫉妒, 接受它, 然后享受和赞美他对儿子产生的积极情绪。

当我们压抑一种自然现象的时候, 那种现象只会加强(That phenomenon only strengthens)。比如演讲的时候, 不断告诉自己不要紧张, 但是这样会让自己更加紧张。这时候就要准许为人, 去上课的时候, 接受他, 教授现在能应付且控制自己的紧张。Rejecting our nature leads to suboptimal performance, emotionally as well as in terms of external performance.

如果我们总是拒绝接受现实, 比如拒绝接受万有引力这个事实, 那么我们的生活将会处处受挫。(Lead a life of constant frustration, refusing to accept something that is there whether you like it or not.) Painful emotions are as much as part of human nature as the law of gravity is part of physical nature.

"Nature to be commanded must be obeyed." 但我们的文化不这么做, 为此我们付出高昂的代价。我们正在经历教授自己所说的"the great deception", 讽刺了我们情绪的压抑以符合大众文化。当然教授不是说我们要肆无忌惮的表达情绪(Wearing our heart on our sleeves). 教授的意义是生活中的私密空间, 比如和挚友一起的时候, 和家人在一起的时候, 最重要(First and foremost)的是面对自己的时候, 我们要准许自己为人。教授说的也不是屈从, 而是active acceptance, it means understanding that certain things I cannot change and certain things I can and ought to change. One of the main ideas we'll talk about is the distinction, between affact, behaviors and cognitions(ABC of psychology).

准许为人主要与affect有关. They are there, just like the law of gravity. That does not mean we need to accept our behavior and our cognition. For example, maybe I envy towards my best friend, that in and of itself does not make me a bad person. It's human. Envy is part of human nature, nothing good or bad about the envy. Nothing good or bad about experiencing the anger. Nothing good or bad about experiencing the depression or anxiety. The question is: **How do I choose to behave to act as a result of it?** That is where the moral domain enters. That is where I can have moral or immoral behavior toward my best friend or baby, or other people in general. I can still experience envy toward my best friend and choose to behave generously and benevolently toward him. The same with cognition.

We can feel affect certain way. But it does not mean that I need to resign to my thoughts about the feeling. Rumination is one of the things that we will talk about a  lot, acutally not that helpful to ruminate about painful emotions. It is much helpful to write about them or to talk to other people about them, rather than just be thinking constantly about how miserable I am because my girlfriend just left. So rumination does not help and we do not necessarily accept all my irrational thoughts and we will talk how we can cognitively reframe what we were thinking. But the emotion, it is what it is. And the key is to be true to reality.

教授半开玩笑的说这不是积极心理学, 是一门"现实心理学"课程。因为积极心理学会让我们只聚焦于积极的起作用的部分, 忽略其他不起作用的。我们要做的就像是改变钟摆的幅度, 让在第一课讲的21:1的比例平衡一些。于此同时, 我们也要认同痛苦的情绪和美好的情绪一样都是人性的组成。只是我们的心理免疫系统会越来越强, 这并不代表我们不再得病。只是意味着我们有了更好的抵抗力, 即使得病, 也会很快康复。当我们准许自己为人时, 自己的免疫就会变强。

The difference between the extremely happy people and extremely unhappy people is not that one gets sad of upset, or anxious, or depressed, and the other does not. Both groups do. It is how quickly, how promptly we can recover from these painful emotions.

教授还让学生做了冥想练习, 尝试接受各种情绪, 感受自我。怪怪的, 不过应该很有用。主要就是接受自我情绪, 这应该以后无聊的时候做一下。

本课是个小高潮, 学到不少东西。
