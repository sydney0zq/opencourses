##Part 07 of Positive Psychology 1504

这节课会把自我实现预言的部分讲完, 然后开始讲专注, 和专注如何创造现实。

教授接着上节课的讲, 如何提升幸福水平的基准线? 第一个是去面对, 把自己处于风险之上, 因为这样能够产生积极的影响 (其中的一个原因是一旦我们经常经历失败, 我们会意识到其实并不那么糟糕, 不像我们想象的那么糟, 我们脑中想象的失败的痛苦比实际的痛苦要多得多, 也许不是即时的, 而是稍后才感受到, 当我们恢复后, 就知道我们能对付它); 第二个方法是首先是采取行动, 尽管去做, 把自己置于风险之上; 最后一点是认知疗法, 也是当今最成功的, 最有效的治疗干预手段。

Note: 对上一段的补充。先说行动, 如果每天只是告诉自己很精神, 很成功, 那么这是不管用的。事实上久的了话会伤及到自己的自尊, 伤害学生的积极性。只给积极的肯定, 不论来自内部还是外部, 是不管用的, 这甚至是有害的。**我们应该对任何事都要付出努力, 我们想要变得自信, 就需要去应对。** 即使是一点点成功的贡献, 也有助于提高自我效能, 有助于增加自信, 而自信反过来激励我们更加努力。我们开始更加相信自己。教授希望我们多经历失败, 学会用不同的方式去诠释, 而不是像大多数人那样诠释失败。

> To dare is to lost one's footing momentarily. Not to dare is to lose oneself.

**The secret of success/something: it is optimism, believe in oneself, passion, loving what you do, and hard work.**

我们的大脑无法识别, 真实的事物和想象的事物。那么当我们想象成功的时候, 从某种意义上说, (为什么这老师这么喜欢成功。。) 我在为大脑做一个模拟, 可以欺骗大脑说这是真的事情。假如在大脑中反复想着已经把某件事情做成功了。(记住大脑不喜欢不一致性) 这样会对我们的帮助很大。当然关键是想象过程, 不要只想结果。这在心理学中我记得很清楚。

教授讲到了路德金的 "I have a dream", 演讲稿非常好, 值得仔细欣赏。所有演讲的特征, 不是抽象的。那些精彩的演讲, 因为他们创造了一幅图画。

Without emotion, there is no motion. If you want to move yourself or others, you need to evoke emotions.

认知疗法的内容如下, 它的基本前提是思想驱动情感 (Thoughts drive emotion)。它的模型见下图, 认知疗法认为如果我们想改变情感, 不论是忧郁或者焦虑, 我们要干预的是 `Evaluation`, the level of evaluation and the level of thought. And if we can change that, we also change our emotion. Specifically, what cognitive therapy saying is that we need to restore sense of rationality. We need to restore the real, but we should know that cognitive therapy is not saying stop feeling nervous, 即认知疗法不是改变我们的自然情感, 感到害怕是自然健康的体验。它说的是我们的想法有的时候是荒谬的, 比如我们一次考试没考好, 立刻认为自己很笨; 或者我约别人被拒绝, 突然觉得没有人需要我。这种事件引发了一个很荒谬的想法 (Irrational evaluation of the situation), 而这会引发不好的情感, 比如放弃 (resignation)。**And what cognitive therapy does is just restore that rationality. Congnitive therapy has been shown to be extremely effective, more effective than any of the other intervention.** The jury still out when it comes to extreme cases of psychopathology, but in terms of most psychopathologies, most anxiety, most depression, it has been shown to be the most successful and it works the fastest. On the whole, not right for everyone, but for most people.

Cognitive Therapy

- Thoughts drive emotion
- Restoring rationality/realism
- Highly effective
- An acquired skill
```

教授又讲道了有 3 个 M 理论, 每个 M 上有 2 个建议。Things that you do yourself, so beyond the lookout ask yourself: "Where do I distort the reality that lead to certain negative emotions that are unnecessary." Because if I restore rationality, I will not feel the same emotion to the same degree. So ask yourself when you look through the 3Ms. **The 3Ms essentially the 3 traps of irrational thoughts. The first one is magnifying. It's extraggerating something that happens.** Induction is something very natural, that's natural and important. That's how we develop concepts and language, but sometimes we take this too far and we over generalize. The `All or Nothing` is catastrophizing failure, not seeing failure as an opportunity. It is one of the key elements that prevents us from coping, from putting ourselves on the line. **The second is minimizing.** The first idea of minimizing is what Karen Reivich calls"tunnel vision". 我们的某些 XX 很容易毁掉本该是一件值得庆祝的事情, 但我们一旦认识它, 一旦了解它以后, 我们可以怀疑它 (dispute it), 可以质疑它 (challenge it), 我们能够重组它 (reframe it) and see the positive as well. **Making up or fabricating the 3rd M. This is when we create somethng exnihilo, from nothing.** So for example, we personalize or we blame. We see this very often with people who are abused. So an abused wife will very often say "It's my fault, I am not behaving appropriately."Instead of rationally saying"This guy is abusive, I am out of here."That's irrational personalization. It can also be the other way around.

	a.Permanent and Pervasive (over-generalizing)
	b.All-or-nothing thinking

```markdown
Get Real!

- Is my conclusion tied to reality?
- Is my conclusion rational?
- Am I ignoring something important?
- What important evidence do I still need to take into consideration?
- What am I magnifying?
- What am I minimizing?
- Am I ignoring anything that is going well?
- Am I ignoring anything that is not going well?
- What is the big picture?

Extremely Happy People 
(Diener and Seligman, 2002)

- Everyone experiences negative emotions
- Different cognitive interpretations (pessimists vs. optimists)
- Self-fulfilling prophecies
- Spiraling down or up
```

There are no short cuts. There are no easy steps to wellbeing, to success, to high level of beliefs in ourselves. It takes work, it takes effort, whether it's work visualizing, whether it's hard work and coping, or whether it's work learning to dispute irrational thoughts. And it is not enough to just understand it once and then we all set, we are all inoculated for the rest of our lives. If you want to continue working, we have to contine working at it.


现在教授开始讲 Focus, 我要去掉之前的冗余, 只留下最核心的笔记。

> "It appears that the way people perceive the world is much more important to happiness than objective circumstances." 

We know a lot of people who seemingly have everything, whether it's wealth, whether it's wonderful friends and family, all their dreams have come true, and they are still miserable. While there are people who have very little, who have experienced hardship after hardship and who never cease to celebrate life. Then there are people who have everything going for them and really appreciate it don't take it for granted and are happy. **It is not just the external that matters, what matters more is the internal. Happiness is not contingent on our status, or the state of our bank account. It's much more dependent on our state of mind, on what we choose to focus on.** Because our emotion are determined by external circumstances as well as internal, interpretation matters.

教授再次强调 **Questios that we ask determine our reality.** 一如上面图片有几个几何形状, 我们就会察觉不到公交车的小孩。

```
Two Archetypes

- The Fault-Finder(always focus on things that don't work)
	- Could lead to resignation

- The Benefit-Finder (Bower, 2007)
	- Could lead to detachment
	- The need to respect reality
```

The fault-finder will find faults even in paradise. The extreme fault-finder experiences resignation, learned helplessness. Because he or she begins to really believe that the terrible reality is very much out there independent of what he or she thinks, not recognizing that they create that reality, they begin to believe that no matter what they do, no matter what they find they have a terrible boss, no matter what partners they have they are always awful and inconsiderate. And they resigned to the reality and that becomes a self-fulfilling prephesy of course their existence.

The benefit-finder looks on the bright side of life, find the silver lining in the dark cloud and doesn't fought an instructor for using too much cliches. The benefit-finder finds the miracle in the common. Now the problem here may be that detached, this is one of the criticisms of people who always see the bright side of life and that is the problem if that is the case. This class is not advocating focusing only on the positive; its focus is advocating reality. The key is to focus on good and bad.

A Matter of Interpretation

"Things don’t necessarily happen for the best, but some people are able to make the best of things that happen."
```

Crises have the potential through growth.  经历过危机和挑战的婚姻最后更美满。维持长期的关系必须靠这个方法: Learn to fail or fail to learn. 恋爱也是起伏不平的, 不是说就在一条基准线上。不是说有些危机必须解决, 有的婚姻确实应该结束, 但多数危机能够被解决, 需要处理好。35 岁和 80 岁的领导人都经历过很困难的危机, 有些人能够从危机中学到。不管现在是在职业, 社会关系, 还是内在个性上的危机, 都可以看作是一次机会。** 教授反复强调要利用危机, 比如吵架啊, 困境啊之类的。总有一些事情会发生, we can either let it pollute or make fertilizer out of it.** 教授经历了很多, 年轻的时候因为背伤无法再打球, 然后又有很多次考试唯一没有通过的。教授认为自己有 ADD 是好事情。因为这实际上迫使他只能学他喜欢的事情, 他关心的事情。其他的事情, 他都集中不了精神。教授开始正面解释自己的经历, 解释的蛮有道理, 对我很有启发。Same reality, different interpretations. Just remember, much of what we experience, we co-create.

> “A pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity;> an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty.”
