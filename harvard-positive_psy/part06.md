##Part 06 of Positive Psychology 1504

上节课结束的地方是分析影射。Priming can be done in the conscious or subconscious level. It means planting a seed, planting a belief, planting a word, or a picture in our mind, consciously or subconsciously. And how that actually influences our behavior. 上世纪有人做实验, 用一些有关年老的词去影射别人, 结果是实验参与者走路更慢了, 更佝偻了。然后就是其他侧面的一些说明, 这种影射的确会让我们发生改变。The power of situation, the power of the environment. 之后科学家用积极的影射, 比如成就, 毅力, 成功等, 这些参与者在智力测试上比对照组要好。

Two Dutch researchers -- Digksterhuis & Knippensberg, what they found was that they brought people, and they ask them to describe for future experiment. Ask them the typical day or typical characteristics of three archetypes: a soccer hooligan, a secretary and a professor. Describe these three archetypes. And they told them this is for the next experiment where we just want people to evaluate these archetypes. 描述后, 他们分别被影射为足球流氓, 秘书和教授。并且实验之后的智力测试和记忆力测试, 描述足球流氓日常行为的人表现最糟, 不论是记忆力还是表现力。表现最好的是描述教授的人。但是他们之前并没有更努力学习过。Nothing changed except for the fact that there was a prime, that there was something planted from the environment in their minds.

这就很显然的引出了, **The question then is, how can we create a positive environment for ourselves, where we are primed by the positive, where we can be happier, more successful and so on.** Here are some examples. Have pictures of people you love or places you love, the importance of these things is that even if you do not see them, you see them. So on the subconscioous level it is still there, even though on the subconscious level when people are primed, they don't really see the word. Say "achievement" on the screen, when it is there for 25 mini-second, they don't really see it, but it registers. So even if a picture is there and you don't "really" see it or not really conscious of it, mindful of it, it still has a compact on you. So have pictures of people you love, hace pleasant object, whether it is memorabilia, whethre it is flowers, whether it is art, your favorite art.

Camus, "In the depth of winter, I finally learned that there was within me an invincible summer."

教授于是就开始将他自己生活中营造积极环境的例子, 比如挂自己喜欢的作品, 看名言等。还说Watch films that inspire you, all these things help you to create an environment that is conductive to growth, to success, to well being. A lot of this is done on the subconscious level, which is the power of the priming. And finally this is what positive research is about. **When you measure a phenomenon, you are changing the phenomenon; when you measuring a phenomenon, you are also changing yourself.** So by researching the positive we are also priming ourselves with the positive. 

Whether you think you can or you can't, you are right. People are drawn by this message because it is empowering, it makes them feel that things are possible.

The secret to success is, what they call, the law of attraction. The law of attaction is that you attract to your life whatever you imaging, whatever you believe it. 教授紧接着就讲到一本流行书籍说相信会成功就会成功的理念, 随即开始对此进行分析。And here is the issue, with much of what's going on in the self-help today, self-help realm today, it draws on a truth, a real truth and then blow it out of proportion. **There is some truth in the fact that our mind creates reality. But that's part of the truth. We create reality or rather we co-create reality. There has to be something out there or in there.** If you believe that you are likely to succeed, you are much more likely to succeed. But that has to come with a lot of hard work and persistence, it has to come with a lot of failure and learning from that failure. So it is just half of the equation and what these self-help books and messages do is overpromise and under-deliver, which at times can be destructive. 教授批评流行书中的观点, 说If everything is created by the law of attraction, then it is a prescription maybe in the short term for inspiration and for belief and for wellbeing, but in the long term, it is for frustration, for gulit, and for unhappiness. And also for less success. 虽然对成功并不感兴趣, 但是还是听一下。

教授播了一段广告, 里面有说"Talk is no substitute for action. That is the power."。教授紧接着说: It captures part of the truth but not the whole truth. So let's see the serious research has to say about the power of the mind. "A real phenomenon, actual phenomenon, but one that we need to also apply real research to see what works." 教授有引用了一段Albert Bandura的论文中的论述(此人已经有几十年的研究), "Belief in personal efficacy affect life choices, level of motivation, quality of functioning, resilience to adversity and vulnerability to stress and depression." Those you believe in themselves, who have confidence, do well across the different areas in their lives. "People who regrad themselves as highly efficacious act, think and feel differently from those who perceive themselves as inefficacious. They produce their own future, rather than simply foretell it." 教授说适应力是可以培养的, 我们可以改变它, 通过后天习得, 而不仅仅是被动接受。

> The level of our self-esteem, in another words, the level of our belief in ourselves, has profound consequences for every aspect of our existence, how we operate in the workspace, how we deal with people, how high we are likely to rise, how much we are likely to achieve, and in personal realm, with whom we are likely to fall in love, how we interact with our spouse, children, and friends, what level of personal happiness we attain.


**Very low levels of correlation between material affluence and wellbeing, or between where we live and wellbeing; very high correlation between self-esteem and wellbeing.** In most reasearch what we found is a 0.7 correlation. So self-esteem matters. The internal matters and what we are doing when we enhance when we raise our levels of belief in ourselves is we are transforming our mind, we are changing the form(自身的容器, 第一节课讲的)。`Self-concept is destiny.`

The Placebo Effect(安慰剂效应)。这我已经很熟悉了。当然安慰剂效应不是说药物没有效果, 只是这些实验让我们意识到我们不应该忽视精神的强大力量, 而需要研究并理解它。

Based on the power of the mind(this does not mean that the external does not matter and that we attracted everything that we want to into our lives), it does mean that the mind plays a very important role in creating our physical, certainly emotional, cognitive as well as external reality. Beliefs very often become self-fulfilling prophecies. But how does it work?

//下面一段很精彩。

教授建立了一个模型, 是教授自己根据这一领域大量研究建立起来的。它基本上解释了我们的信念及希望, 是如何影响我们的表现的。不管是安慰剂效应还是学习, 体育运动, 恋爱关系等, 生活各个方面的表现。In other words, what comes in the box here? What comes, what mediate between beliefs, exceptations and actual performance in the real world? **I want to talk abou two mechanisms. The first one is very straight forward, relatively simple, it is motivation.** So if I believe that I can do well, I am much more likely to be motivated than if you think that you are hopeless and have no chance, you are much more likely to resign and not do anything. You are much more likely to be motivated before the event whatever the event may be, in training, in practice, as well as during the event, while it is taking place. **There is another thing though, in addition to motivation, and that is the notion of consistency or congruence.** We all have a mental schema of the world of the way the world should be, or to be, or is. For example, I have a mental schema that suggests that things will fall when left in middle air. I have a schema about my ability in math that I might be a good mathematician that I have potential in this area or not; I also have the schema about other people, I like this person. This is inside, the schema. **In the outside world, actual things take place. For example, when this is left in the middle air, it falls. This has nothing to do with my schema.** It happens outside, regradless of my schema. A certain person behaves generously and benevolently toward other people or in a hateful manner toward other people regardless of my schema. So there is what is inside and what is outside, and here is the key point. **Our mind does not like when there is a discrepancy between what is inside and what is outside. The mind likes when there is consistency, congruence between the two, and if there is no congruence.** If there is congruence, then we experience a sense of dissidence, then we experience disease. Does not feel right and we do, very often. **Everything that we can to get the two on par again. Either by changing the external reality or by changing our mind to match the external reality.** We do not like when there is inconsistency.

The first thing we can do when there is a discrepancy:

- Update the schema
- Ignore or discard in external information(More often)
- Actively seek confirmation
- Create a new reality

The thing though is, that we perform with high motivation, low motivation might looking for consistency. All what is left us to do is to interpret our performance.(感觉语法有错误) Was it successful, and good or bad? And there are two forms of interpretation. One is the objective interpretation. There is also the subjective interpretation based on my beliefs. 一如爱迪生被采访时, 别人对他说, 你已经失败5000次了, 但是爱迪生说我证明了哪5000次是行不通的。爱迪生的主观判定是他走向成功的敲门砖。爱迪生一共有1000多个专利, 很多产, 很有创造力。这不是偶然。Dean Simonton研究表明, the most successful scientists and artists through our history were also the ones who failed the most times. No short cuts. It is not enough to just sit down and think, and conceive and believe, we need to do much more than that.

//本段也讲的很好。

Martin Seligman, considered father of positive psychology, has done a lot of work on optimism and pessimism. And here he found, **what he found was that when it comes to goal setting, pessimists are realistic in terms of their short term goals as well as their long term goals. Whereas optimisms are unrealistic when it comes to their short term goals, but are realistic when it comes to their long term goals.** Why is that? Let's look at the model again. Pessimists first, they have certain goal and they have low expectations, low levels of beliefs, they don't think they would do well. Low levels of motivation, their mind looks for consistency and their performance is usually according to their beliefs and expectations. And their interpretation is "I could not do well here". And then everyone else in a chorus says, "Yes, you told us so. How wonderfully realistic of you!". But then sometimes a pessimist succeeds beyond his or her expectations, and then what happens? The interpretation is, low levels of beliefs, "Well, it was lucky". And then, the mind is looking for consistency, they go around that loop again and again. | The optimist starts with high levels of beliefs, high levels of expectations, motivation, incredibly high. Their mind looking for consistency, performance, not so good as the expectations were. However, the interpretation, because of high levels of beliefs, the subjective interpretation is "OK, what if I learn from it? This is an opportunity. I've actually got better this time.". And they still have high levels of belief and epectations. Movtivation is high, and their mind looks for consistency, they perform, still not good as they expected, unrealistic. But the interpretation, what if I learn from it? I've gone even better this time. I've shown what doesn't work, and they continue. But then comes the quarrels from the outside and says, "Come on, really, why can't you be realistic?". But they believed that they can do it, and they continue to persist and to work hard again and again. Even 10000 times, until they bring the "unrealistic reality" and make it realistic to match their beliefs over time. So even though in the short term, the reality may not match, but I will get there eventually and make my "unrealistic expectations" and goals realistic. Through a lot of failure, through a lot of hard work, through a lot of persistence. MS这些理论并非只是某种遇事过分乐观的自我感觉良好, 而是关于我们如何解释事件。比如, 我们如何解释我的失败。(这个问题我需要在以后的人生中密切关注, 这个对任何事情解释很重要。)

并且乐观能够增加我们身体上的免疫力。

There is a problem here though, how do I distinguish between this and realistic optimism and unrealistic optimism? 教授这时就讲到了The Stockdale parabox, which is about finding the tension, reconciling the tension and it is not easy. 当然这不是一个定势, 不是说某种规则, 而是说是作为一个启发式。当我们思考信念的时候, 存在一些需要思考的东西。教授举了一个例子, 关于越南时期战俘, 它发现那些活下来的人有两个特点, 第一个, 他们相信他们能出去, 他们坚信终有一天他们会重获得自由, 这种信念支持着他们走下去; 第二个特点, 他们有着现实的信念, 能对情况做出估计。如果这两点没有做到, 那么他们就不大可能活下来, 环境很恶劣。

> You must never confuse faith that you would prevail in the end which you can never afford to lose with the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality whatever they might be.

False optimism sooner or later means disillusionment, anger and hopelessness.

Optimism, passion, hard work. ->Go success.

为什么亲人朋友常常降低我们的期望呢?

**我们的幸福是在一个基准线上下波动的。那么我们如何提高自己的幸福/自尊基准线呢? 来提高自尊, 就是面对而非逃避困难。(To cope as opposed to avoid.)** 去面对意味着把自己置身于风险线, 不是在恐慌的时候冒险, 而是在放松的时候放手一搏, 去承担失败的风险, 去解决, 去处理, 去面对那些对于我来说很重要的事情。如, 参加戏剧试演, 讨论时说出未曾表达的观点。去尝试。这样会让我们的幸福曲线基线一直攀升, 虽然也是起伏的。那么为什么基础水平提高了呢? 三个原因: 首先是自我知觉理论, 即我们得出关于自己的结论和我们得出关于他人的结论的方式是一样的(通过观察自己某些方式的行为, 我会得到关于自己自尊或者仁慈或者慷慨或者其他方面的结论); 

Note: 补上一段, When we fail after coping we realize that the actual pain that comes with failure is far less than the pain we imagine and that we associate with failure.

Learn to fail or fail to learn.

教授好烦, 最后不是说三个原因吗, 为什么只说了一个? 奇怪。
