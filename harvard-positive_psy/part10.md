##Part 10 of Positive Psychology 1504

The important thing to keep in mind with both forms of changes, with all form of change, lasting change that is, which is what we are about. **Not just the spike and the return to base level.**

在改变之前, 教授问了一个让人深思的问题: Do you really want to change? Do I really want to improve certain things in my personality or character, or behavior, things that I don't like.

```
But do I really want to change?(Langer & Thompson 1989)

下面的每一对是相互有联系的性格, 我们可能不能丢弃某一个导致两个都无法改变。教授被完美主义伤害, 和它密切相连的是动力和雄心。比如责任感和焦虑与担忧联系在一起。

Rigidity			Consistency
Gullibility			Trustworthiness
Grimness			Seriousness
Perfectionism		Drive/ambition
Worry/anxiety		Responsibility
Guilt				Empathy/sensitivity
Simplify			Lose edge
Fault-finding		Realism
(People associate happiness with slacking off)
Happiness			No pain no gain

A more nuanced understanding of what change.
```

本段对我启发很大, 现摘录全文: What goes hand in hand for me with perfectionism? What goes hand in hand is drive and ambition. And because I didn't want to lose these characteristics, my subconscious stops me from getting rid of the perfectionism. Professor associated a positive trait which is responsibility.

The dominant mantra in our culture today is "no pain, no gain". If I am happy now, I ignore experiencing pain. It means I am letting go. It means I am not gonna be successful. It means I am gonna lose my edge. It means I am gonna lose my drive and ambition. So our subconscious perfers to keep us unhappy so that we don't lose the other things that we value highly, such as ambition and having an edge and hard work. No of course when we look at them, we know that they don't necessarily have to go hand in hand. **Learning from failures looking at it as a stepping stone that contributes to our success in the long term.** It doesn't need to take away from our drive and ambition on the contrary. And the key if we wanna overcome this fear of failure or the worry/anxiety, or the guilt, or the slack of happiness, it is very often about understanding, or getting a better understanding of these characteristics. **Evey one is afraid of failure to some extent, but to let go of the debilitating fear of failure and yet maintain my drive/ambition. So more in nuance understanding that you need to go hand in hand.** 教授说之前不拒绝别人, 因为他眼中的自己和他希望别人眼中的自己是有同情心的。教授说这种不拒绝是因为我们把他们连在了一起, 我们可以善解人意的说不, 因为很多时候当我对别人说好, 我其实同时在对自己说不。从长远看来, 也是在对亲密关系说不, 所以现在我更好且更深入的了解了, 我什么时候能说不, 什么时候不想说, 同时我还能保留自己的善解人意和同情心, 也不必在每次说不的时候感到有种罪恶感。

我们能够分出我们需要改变的东西的前提是我们必须搞清楚, ** 我们到底要改变什么?**

Learning (and applying) Your ABC’s

- Affect 
- Behavior
- Cognition
Need all three,  we need to focus on the three.
```

It is like a habit can be looked as a flood. There is flood in our mind of certain neurons firing in certain neuron pathway. And what we want to do is to overcome this flood, therefore we want to use as many approaches as we can.

我们在试图分析一个人的幸福感的时候, 我们需要研究三个因素, 第一个是遗传排列, 我们生来都具有特定的快乐和健康倾向性体质 (Some people are born more with the smiley face with smiley spoon in their mouth, other less so), 教授强调这好像万有引力, 这是事实, 无所谓好坏, 要想支配天性, 必先服从天性, 大概有 50% 是有基因支配的。教授也强调了那些有快乐基因的人, 不去努力争取幸福的人, 即使他们有最好的遗传基因, 也不会必基因不如他们但努力争取的人快乐。所以说后天努力很重要; 第二个是外界环境, 但是外部环境只要不过于极端, 其实影响不大, 只有大概 10% 的作用; 第三点是由意志活动决定。这些 ABC 就是我们关注的重点, 也是产生有意义的变化的根源, 是我们即将关注的焦点。能改变我们结果的, 能被我们所掌控的, 是内部活动, 使我们对世界的诠释。

```
Happiness =
Genetic set range
+
External circumstances
+
Intentional activities
(ABC)
```


###Affect: Our Emotions

没有情感我们将寸步难行。这是有实验证明的, 一个人失去了情感能力, 他一步也不能动, 尽管他还有认知的能力。我们要行动就必须有情感。教授会从两个方面谈情感, 一个是渐进式变化, 之后是突发式变化。渐进式变化, 是一种专注冥想。Mindful meditation is arguably the most powerful intervention for bringing about calm and equanimity.

```
Gradual Change: Mindfulness Meditation

> “Cultivating mindfulness can lead to the discovery of deep realms of relaxation, calmness, and insight within yourself... The path to it in any moment lies no farther than your own body and mind and your own breathing.” Jon Kabatt-Zin
> 
> “All of us have the capacity to be mindful.  All it involves is cultivating our ability to pay attention in the present moment.” Jon Kabatt-Zin
> 
> “Mindfulness means seeing things as they are, without trying to change them.  The point is to dissolve our reactions to disturbing emotions, being careful not to reject the emotion itself.”	Tara Bennett-Goleman
```

```
Acute Change

- Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)
- Widespread (Society for Neuroscience)
- Creating new pathways (shock treatment)
- Post traumatic growth (Tedeschi & Calhoun)

*Is there a positive equivalent to trauma?*

Can a single positive experience create a positive channel that will lead to a permanent increase in well-being, calm, and positive memories?
```

研究发现, 实际上更多的人在经历创伤后, 得到的是成长, 而不是应激障碍, 然而没人提起创伤后成长, 但每个人都知道 PTSD, 这也是人们不愿意去看正面事物的案例。大部分都是非常有能力去承受创伤的, 这是个非常振奋人心的事实, 这意味着我们会有更多自我实现的预言。教授就想, 会不会有一种正面的经历可以创造, 一条正向的通道, 引领我们得到更多健康, 宁静和积极的回忆。一个假设的理论是, 马斯洛的高峰体验 (peak experience), 在下方的框中。Peak experience 是一个高峰, 不会持续太久, 但是它是有震荡效应的。马斯洛的一个学生研究谈到, 生孩子的时候会达到高峰体验, 体验带来的后果是, 她们变得更自信, 更宽容, 更友善, 更快乐, 一切都源于一个单独的人生体验。

```
Acute Change Through Peak Experience

“The term peak experiences is a generalization for the best moments of the human being, for the happiest moments of life, for experiences of ecstasy, rapture, bliss, of the greatest joy. I found that such experiences came from profound aesthetic experiences such as creative ecstasies, moments of mature love, perfect sexual experiences, parental love, experiences of natural childbirth, and many others.” Abraham Maslow

Peak experience as ‘positive trauma’

“Peak experiences often have consequences...  They can do the same there as psychotherapy, if one keeps his goals right, and if one knows just what he is about, and if one is conscious of what he is going toward.  We can certainly talk, on the one hand, of the breaking up of symptoms, like the breaking up of cliches, of anxieties, or the like; or on the other hand, we can talk about the development of spontaneity, and of courage, and of Olympian or Godlike humor and suchness, sensory awareness, body awareness, and the like.” Abraham Maslow

Peak experiences can lead to a new brain order
```

```
Making the Most of Peak Experiences

- Enhancing the likelihood of PE
	- acceptance
	- mindfulness
	- music and dance
	- meaningful goal
	- taking time
- Enhancing the likelihood of PPEO
	- replaying and imagining
	- journaling (describing)
	- taking time
	- taking action
```

我们现在文化最重要的问题是时间, 当我们匆匆忙忙赶时间, 倍感压力和焦虑的时候, 我们很难获得高峰体验。


###Behavior: Taking Action

```
Permanent Change

Attitude------>Behavior
↑				  |
+-----------------+
```

教授发现听过他课的同学有的会将幸福线提升, 大多数人不会提升, 主要区别是是否进行了立即的行动。这部分提升的人不会等到课程都结束了才做, 而是每节课都立马行动, 重新评估人生, 看看自己能做什么, 并且立即采取实质上的行为改变。总之, 立刻改变, 而不是等着。

态度和行为是紧密相关的。所以我们都有自己的态度, 不论是关于心理学的态度, 还是关于其他人。这些态度影响着我们的行为。但是从心理学上的课本有讲到, 行为同样能影响态度。这是一条双行线。Habits are behavioral patterns, thinking patterns. Behaviors are more powerful, action is more powerful than words.

课堂只能激发同学们在态度上面的转变, 但是无法影响行为, 由于大脑认知的一致性, 所以我们需要行动保持一致性。一如面部表情会回馈给身体的其他部位, 因为我们体内释放了相应的化学物质。

Behavior Changing Attitudes

- POWs in Korea (Schein, 1956)
- Cognitive Dissonance (Festinger, 1959)
- Self-perception theory (Bem, 1967)
- Facial feedback hypothesis (Ekman, 1983)
- Body feedback hypothesis
- Overcoming shyness (Haemmerlie, 1987)
- Fake it till you make it (Myers, 1992)

> “Whistling to keep up courage is no mere figure of speech. On the other hand, sit all day in a moping posture, sigh, and reply to everything with a dismal voice, and your melancholy lingers... Smooth the brow, brighten the eye, contract the dorsal rather than the ventral aspect of the frame, and speak in a major key, pass the genial compliment, and your heart must be frigid indeed if it does not gradually thaw.” William James
```

Coping (Bednar and Peterson, 1995)

- Exiting comfort zone

教授讲第二个故事是他想找到自己女性化的一面, 因为我们的文化总是说男的不要哭。教授穿着粉红的衣服惊艳全场, 笑喷。

Nothing will happen unless we bring about real actual behavioral change and action.
