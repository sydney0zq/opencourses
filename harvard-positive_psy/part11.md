Dan Millman’s Advice on Change

"To change the course of your life, choose one of two basic methods:
1. You can direct your energy and attention toward trying to fix your mind, find your focus, affirm your power, free your emotions and visualize positive outcomes so that you can finally develop the confidence to display the courage to discover the determination to make the commitment to feel sufficiently motivated to do what it is you need to do.
2. Or you can just do it."
```

**When the task that you are doing or whatever you are doing, is not too difficult nor too easy.** Stretch but not too much. This is the health way of approaching change. 有的时候我们必须进入恐怖区, 以至于无法慢慢的改变。例如 addiction。

如果我们认为自律能够获得更多的幸福的话, 会导致两方面的问题, 坏方面是我们不会获得更多的自律, 现在拥有的就将是全部, 大多数人认为他们需要并且想要更加自律; 好消息是更多的自律事实上并不重要, 不管是对于成功还是对于幸福感, 只用现有的自律也可以变得更幸福, 更快乐。要做的就是, 把注意力从依靠自律性来获得改变, 转到引入例行公事上面来, 即将我们的注意力从自律转向例行公事。自律对与幸福和成功是不够的, 正是由于人们依赖自律来获得改变, 这就是为什么许多组织和个人的尝试改变的努力都失败了。

自律是有限的, 用了一部分然后对于别的东西自律就减少了, 即我们的自律是有限的, 问题是我们将它用在了哪里。教授这时候提出了刷牙这个场景, 它并不是自律, 只不过是每天都会做的例行公事。

> “Building rituals requires defining very precise behaviors and performing them at very specific times—motivated by deeply held values.” Loher & Schwartz

教授和他的妻子有每周两次的例行约会。在现代社会, 我们的时代中有许多相互冲突的需求。例行公事不但很重要, 它们也是必须的。如果我们要做对我们重要的, 我们所关心的事。这些例行公事确实能产生很重要的影响。当然也有其他形式的例行公事, 比如三小时不查邮件。如果我们持续和技术相连的时候, 我们就会经常与生活中重要的事情脱节。

```
From Self Discipline to Rituals

- Increases productivity and creativity
- 30 days to a new ritual(每三十天不要建立超过两件例行公事)
- Introduce one or two rituals at a time

> “Incremental change is better than ambitious failure... Success feeds on itself.” Loehr and Schwartz

> “There isn’t anything that isn’t made easier through constant familiarity and training. Through training we can change; we can transform ourselves.” Dalai Lama
```

** 一旦我们专注, 我们就有了创造的空间。 现在关键是花时间来建立例行公事。保持例行公事需要一定的自律, 但是并不多。建立例行公事需要大量的自律, 因为我们时常会回到旧习惯。并且我们的自律是有限的。**

例行公事, 非常重要且有意义, 做出持久改变的唯一方法。

### Cognition: Thoughts Create Worlds

Cognitive Reconstruction Revisited

- Interpretation as neural pathway
- The world according to the fault-finder
- The (same) world according to the merit-finder
- The identical twins, opposite results (revisited)
- Changing our interpretation style takes time
```


```
Examples of Cognitive Reconstruction

- **Challenge or threat** (Tomaka et al., 1997)
- Arousal as euphoria or anger (Schachter & Singer, 1962)
- Cooperation or competition (Ross & Samuels, 1993)
- Volunteering as privilege or duty (Lareau, 2004)
- Relationships about being known or being validated (Schnarch, 1997)
- Failure as opportunity or disaster
- Work as exercise or chore (Crum & Langer, 2007)[取决于我们的观念, 这非常重要]
```

我们对同一种生理现象上的解释愉悦或者愤怒, 它们是十分相似的。两者都涉及到肾上腺素的急剧升高。**If we want long-term, successful, thriving, passionate relationship, the first and primary objective is to go into relationship to be known, rather than validated. Doing it gradually. Thinking about it, but opening up more and more. And couples who over time open up more and more are able to sustain the relationship as well as their passion, over time. This is one of the central pillars of successful long-term relationships.** Also with students, the same applies. **No matter what relationship, when we go in with the intention of being known of expressing rather than impressing.** We can feel so much lighter. And that also makes the relationship so much healthier.

Acute Change: The Eureka Experience

- The Creative Process
	- preparation—immersion
	- incubation—idle time
	- eureka—insight
	- evaluation—reality test
	- elaboration—coherence

> I can do a year’s work in nine months, but not in twelve. --JP Morgan

> “You must have a room, or a certain hour or so a day, when you don’t know what was in the newspapers that morning, you don’t know who your friends are, you don’t know what you owe anybody, you don’t know what anybody owes to you.  This is a place where you can simply experience and bring forth what you are and what you might be.  This is the place of creative incubation.  At first, you may find that nothing happens there.  But if you have [such] a sacred place and use it, something eventually will happen.” Joseph Campbell

教授说 making love 需要有前戏。这也是创造力的过程的一部分。前戏对爱情意义重大。评估非常重要。
