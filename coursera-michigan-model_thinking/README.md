##Model Thinking

<https://www.coursera.org/learn/model-thinking/>


In this free, online course, we're going to learn a variety of models. These models will help you to better understand the world, to be a clearer thinker, to better use data, and to make better decisions. The course will consist of a series of topics focussing on a particular model or class of models. Each week, we'll cover two topics.


Section 1: Introduction: Why Model?
===================================

In these lectures, I describe some of the reasons why a person would want to take a modeling course. These reasons fall into four broad categories:

- To be an intelligent citizen of the world
- To be a clearer thinker
- To understand and use data
- To better decide, strategize, and design

There are two readings for this section. These should be read either after the first video or at the completion of all of the videos.
